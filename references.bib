	abstract = {A method is presented which allows one to estimate, based on the maximum lengths of  a series of length-frequency samples, and on the theory of extreme values, a single, expected largest value (Lm ) and its confidence interval. The method is applied to two sets of samples of chub mackerel, Rastrelliger brachysoma from the Central Philippines.},
