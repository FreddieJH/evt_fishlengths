	abstract = {Decreasing body size has been proposed as a universal response to increasing temperatures. The physiology behind the response is well established for ectotherms inhabiting aquatic environments: as higher temperatures decrease the aerobic capacity, individuals with smaller body sizes have a reduced risk of oxygen deprivation. However, empirical evidence of this response at the scale of communities and ecosystems is lacking for marine ﬁsh species. Here, we show that over a 40-year period six of eight commercial ﬁsh species in the North Sea examined underwent concomitant reductions in asymptotic body size with the synchronous component of the total variability coinciding with a 1–2 °C increase in water temperature. Smaller body sizes decreased the yield-per-recruit of these stocks by an average of 23\%. Although it is not possible to ascribe these phenotypic changes unequivocally to temperature, four aspects support this interpretation: (i) the synchronous trend was detected across species varying in their life history and life style; (ii) the decrease coincided with the period of increasing temperature; (iii) the direction of the phenotypic change is consistent with physiological knowledge; and (iv) no cross-species synchrony was detected in other species-speciﬁc factors potentially impacting growth. Our ﬁndings support a recent model-derived prediction that ﬁsh size will shrink in response to climate-induced changes in temperature and oxygen. The smaller body sizes being projected for the future are already detectable in the North Sea.},

By including a base temperature (To) the DD formula limits calculations to temperatures that are relevant to growth. However, our review of growth studies shows multiple To values in use for a given ﬁsh species. To determine how To affects the ability of DD to explain within-population growth variation, we ﬁrst show that the ability of DD to describe a growing season is robust to low values of To. We then analyze immature length data from eight species and 85 water bodies in North America to show that there is a broad range of To values that effectively explain growth variation. Based on these results, we argue that precise To estimates are unwarranted for most single-population studies and recommend standard To values (0, 5, 10, 15 °C). Standardization facilitates comparative studies and promotes the use of DD in future research. To this end, we provide equations for converting annual DD at a given To to annual DD at a standard To.},

Although the growth of juvenile Chinook Salmon has been well studied, research has focused on a single population, a narrow range of ﬁsh sizes, or a narrow range of temperatures. Therefore, we incorporated the Ratkowsky model for temperature-dependent growth into an allometric growth model; this model was then ﬁtted to growth data from 11 data sources representing nine populations of juvenile Chinook Salmon. The model ﬁt the growth data well, explaining 98\% of the variation in ﬁnal mass. The estimated allometric mass exponent (b) was 0.338 (SE D 0.025), similar to estimates reported for other salmonids. This estimate of b will be particularly useful for estimating mass-standardized growth rates of juvenile Chinook Salmon. In addition, the lower thermal limit, optimal temperature, and upper thermal limit for growth were estimated to be 1.8 C (SE D 0.63 C), 19.0 C (SE D 0.27 C), and 24.9 C (SE D 0.02 C), respectively.

            Fisheries science and management is founded upon the Beverton–Holt theory of fish stock demography. The theory uses age as the structuring variable; however, there are several reasons to use body size as the structuring variable. Most of the processes that affect a fish are determined by its body size rather than its age: consumption, mortality, maturation, fecundity, fish gear selectivity, etc., and measurements of body size are easy, accurate, and abundant. Here, I review size-based theory of a fish stock and compare it to classic age-based theory. I show that size- and age-based demography are equivalent representations of demography. However, size-based theory is axiomatic, which leads to a deeper theory with two advantages: predictions need fewer parameters than age-based theory and the theory connects directly to life-history traits. The connection with traits makes size-based theory particularly useful for data-poor application and facilitates evolutionary calculations. I compare age- and size-based theories for fisheries impact and stock assessments and provide a perspective on the challenges and future of single-stock theory.},

            Less variable than life history parameters (LHPs), it is life history ratios (LHRs) that define how taxa allocate energy between growth, maintenance and reproduction, and respond to fishing pressure. Limited by small samples, variable data quality, and a focus on LHP estimation, previous meta-analyses have failed to settle debate about the extent to which LHRs are relatively invariant across all taxa or characteristic of specific taxa. We collected de novo 1335 published studies and applying rigorous standardization and quality control procedures developed, and make available, a database of high-quality M/K and Lm/L∞ estimates. We describe two parallel but independent meta-analyses: a cross-validation study of the predictability of M/K by taxonomic category and an evaluation of alternative relationships between the LHRs using Akaike information criteria. These analyses demonstrate that the LHRs are correlated and vary predictably by taxa, with aggregation to the level of family and genera having the most predictive power in our database. We postulate that the LHRs of taxa may relate to their stoichiometric niches, which could open up interesting lines for ecological research and provide new tools for predicting the LHRs of poorly studied taxa.},

In contrast, the Gill Oxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT) suggests that growth and maximum size in fishes and other aquatic, water-­breathing organisms is constrained by the body mass-­scaling of gill surface area. Here, we use new data and a novel phylogenetic Bayesian multilevel modelling framework to test this idea by asking the three questions posed by the GOLT regarding maximum size, growth and gills. Across fishes, we ask whether the body mass-­scaling of gill surface area explains (1) variation in the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (k) above and beyond that explained by asymptomatic size (W∞), (2) variation in growth performance (a trait that integrates the tradeoff between k and W∞) and (3) more variation in growth performance compared to activity (as approximated by caudal fin aspect ratio). Overall, we find that there is only a weak relationship among maximum size, growth and gill surface area across species. Indeed, the body mass-­scaling of gill surface area does not explain much variation in k (especially for those species that reach the same W∞) or growth performance. Activity explained three to five times more variation in growth performance compared to gill surface area. Our results suggest that in fishes, gill surface area is not the only factor that explains variation in maximum size and growth, and that other covariates (e.g. activity) are likely important in understanding how growth, maximum size and other life history traits vary across species.},

This theory has been suggested to explain numerous phenomena observed with warming yet is based upon a relationship among maximum size, growth, and gill surface area established over 40 years ago. However, the metric used in this relationship to characterize gill surface area, gill area index, fails to capture the known variability in the scaling of gill surface area and is biased by the sizes at which gills were measured. Here, we revisit a central prediction of the GOLT, asking four key questions that examine limitations in the original relationship. We find that gill area index does indeed explain variation in growth performance across 132 species of fish and this relationship is strikingly similar to the original relationship across 42 species. Yet, we argue that gill area index is not an adequate measure of gill surface area because (1) gill surface area has a non-­linear relationship with size and, thus, changes ontogenetically as an individual grows over time and (2) because it is based on mean estimates of both gill surface area and body mass. Indeed, we show that the value of gill area index for a given species is variable depending on how it is calculated. We therefore suggest a pathway forward for assessing whether gill surface area is an important factor in explaining variation in growth performance.},

Growth of small ﬁsh over relatively short periods of time is commonly modelled with an exponential function using instantaneous growth rate (g). Instantaneous growth rates are logarithmic and inherently difﬁcult to interpret, but speciﬁc growth rates (SGR) express growth as the intuitively understandable per cent change in size per unit of time. A simple metric of SGR (G) is easily computed by exponentiating g, subtracting 1 and multiplying by 100. However, several prominent ﬁsheries publications suggest that SGR should be calculated by simply multiplying g by 100 (we call this G*). A search of the ﬁsheries literature found that the number of papers that used SGR for ﬁsh increased signiﬁcantly from 1830 papers in 2009 to 3170 papers in 2018. An extensive review of 300 papers from this search found that 92.6\% were related to aquaculture and only 3.3\% of all papers correctly used G to calculate SGR. We algebraically show that G* is fundamentally different than G and cannot be interpreted as a per cent change in weight per unit of time. Furthermore we demonstrate, with three examples from the literature, that using G* as if it were the same as G leads to biologically meaningful underestimates of true growth rates and estimated weights. Given these results and the simplicity with which G can be computed from g, we recommend that ﬁsheries scientists abandon the pervasive practice of incorrectly measuring SGR as 100 times the instantaneous growth rate.},

Known as the temperature-­size rule (TSR), this pattern is commonly attributed to higher metabolism in warmer waters, leaving fewer resources for growth. An alternative explanation focuses on growth and reproduction trade-­offs across temperatures. We tested these hypotheses by measuring growth, maturation, metabolism and reproductive allocation from zebrafish populations kept at 26 and 30°C across six generations. Zebrafish growth and maturation followed TSR expectations but were not explained by baseline metabolic rate, which converged between temperature treatments after a few generations. Rather, we found that females at 30°C allocated more to reproduction, especially when maturing at the smallest sizes. We show that elevated temperatures do not necessarily increase baseline metabolism if sufficient acclimation is allowed and call for an urgent revision of modelling assumptions used to predict population and ecosystem responses to warming.},

Six of the eight species show significant changes in growth rates during the last century, with the pattern differing systematically with depth. Increasing temperatures near the ocean surface correlate with increasing growth rates by species found in depths {\textless}250 m, whereas growth rates of deep-water ({\textgreater}1,000 m) species have declined substantially during the last century, which correlates with evidence of long-term cooling at these depths. The observations suggest that global climate change has enhanced some elements of productivity of the shallow-water stocks but also has reduced the productivity, and possibly the resilience, of the already slow-growing deep-water species.},

            Declines in animal body sizes are widely reported and likely impact ecological interactions and ecosystem services. For harvested species subject to multiple stressors, limited understanding of the causes and consequences of size declines impedes prediction, prevention, and mitigation. We highlight widespread declines in Pacific salmon size based on 60 years of measurements from 12.5 million fish across Alaska, the last largely pristine North American salmon-producing region. Declines in salmon size, primarily resulting from shifting age structure, are associated with climate and competition at sea. Compared to salmon maturing before 1990, the reduced size of adult salmon after 2010 has potentially resulted in substantial losses to ecosystems and people; for Chinook salmon we estimated average per-fish reductions in egg production (−16\%), nutrient transport (−28\%), fisheries value (−21\%), and meals for rural people (−26\%). Downsizing of organisms is a global concern, and current trends may pose substantial risks for nature and people.},

We quantified changes in mean body size and contributions from shifting size-at-age and age structure of mature sockeye salmon returning to Bristol Bay, Alaska, over the past 60 years. Mean length declined by 3\%, corresponding to a 10\% decline in mean body mass, since the early 1960s, though much of this decline occurred since the early 2000s. Changes in size-at-age were the dominant cause of body size declines and were more consistent than trends in age structure among the major rivers that flow into Bristol Bay. Annual variation in size-at-age was largely explained by competition among Bristol Bay sockeye salmon and interspecific competition with other salmon in the North Pacific Ocean. Warm winters were associated with better growth of sockeye salmon, whereas warm summers were associated with reduced growth. Our findings point to competition at sea as the main driver of sockeye salmon size declines, and emphasize the trade-off between fish abundance and body size.},

            Biologists have long sought to understand how differences in the structure of vertebrate respiratory systems are related to differences in oxygen consumption rates associated with metabolism. In particular, they have sought to understand how structural constraints on passive oxygen diffusion through gills or lungs are related to the nonlinear body mass scaling of oxygen consumption rates. Here we show that the body mass dependence of oxygen diffusion capacity, which is governed by the area and thickness of respiratory surfaces, matches the body mass dependence of respiration in diverse endothermic (birds and mammals) and ectothermic (reptiles, amphibians, and fishes) vertebrates. These results provide a step toward a more complete understanding of the structural differences that underlie changes in oxygen consumption rates with body size.
          , 
            The area and thickness of respiratory surfaces, and the constraints they impose on passive oxygen diffusion, have been linked to differences in oxygen consumption rates and/or aerobic activity levels in vertebrates. However, it remains unclear how respiratory surfaces and associated diffusion rates vary with body mass across vertebrates, particularly in relation to the body mass scaling of oxygen consumption rates. Here we address these issues by first quantifying the body mass dependence of respiratory surface area and respiratory barrier thickness for a diversity of endotherms (birds and mammals) and ectotherms (fishes, amphibians, and reptiles). Based on these findings, we then use Fick’s law to predict the body mass scaling of oxygen diffusion for each group. Finally, we compare the predicted body mass dependence of oxygen diffusion to that of oxygen consumption in endotherms and ectotherms. We find that the slopes and intercepts of the relationships describing the body mass dependence of passive oxygen diffusion in these two groups are statistically indistinguishable from those describing the body mass dependence of oxygen consumption. Thus, the area and thickness of respiratory surfaces combine to match oxygen diffusion capacity to oxygen consumption rates in both air- and water-breathing vertebrates. In particular, the substantially lower oxygen consumption rates of ectotherms of a given body mass relative to those of endotherms correspond to differences in oxygen diffusion capacity. These results provide insights into the long-standing effort to understand the structural attributes of organisms that underlie the body mass scaling of oxygen consumption.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of human activities threatens ocean-wide biodiversity. Numerous marine animal populations have declined, yet it remains unclear whether these trends are symptomatic of a chronic accumulation of global marine extinction risk. We present the first systematic analysis of threat for a globally distributed lineage of 1,041 chondrichthyan fishes—sharks, rays, and chimaeras. We estimate that one-quarter are threatened according to IUCN Red List criteria due to overfishing (targeted and incidental). Large-bodied, shallow-water species are at greatest risk and five out of the seven most threatened families are rays. Overall chondrichthyan extinction risk is substantially higher than for most other vertebrates, and only one-third of species are considered safe. Population depletion has occurred throughout the world’s ice-free waters, but is particularly prevalent in the Indo-Pacific Biodiversity Triangle and Mediterranean Sea. Improved management of fisheries and trade is urgently needed to avoid extinctions and promote population recovery.
          , 
            Ocean ecosystems are under pressure from overfishing, climate change, habitat destruction and pollution. These pressures have led to documented declines of some fishes in some places, such as those living in coral reefs and on the high seas. However, it is not clear whether these population declines are isolated one-off examples or, instead, if they are sufficiently widespread to risk the extinction of large numbers of species.
            Most fishes have a skeleton that is made of bone, but sharks and rays have a skeleton that is made of cartilage. A total of 1,041 species has such a skeleton and they are collectively known as the Chondrichthyes. To find out how well these fish are faring, Dulvy et al. worked with more than 300 scientists around the world to assess the conservation status of all 1,041 species.
            Based on this, Dulvy et al. estimate that one in four of these species are threatened with extinction, mainly as a result of overfishing. Moreover, just 389 species (37.4\% of the total) are considered to be safe, which is the lowest fraction of safe species among all vertebrate groups studied to date.
            The largest sharks and rays are in the most peril, especially those living in shallow waters that are accessible to fisheries. A particular problem is the ‘fin trade’: the fins of sharks and shark-like rays are a delicacy in some Asian countries, and more than half of the chondrichthyans that enter the fin trade are under threat. Whether targeted or caught by boats fishing for other species, sharks and rays are used to supply a market that is largely unmonitored and unregulated. Habitat degradation and loss also pose considerable threats, particularly for freshwater sharks and rays.
            Dulvy et al. identified three main hotspots where the biodiversity of sharks and rays was particularly seriously threatened—the Indo-Pacific Biodiversity Triangle, Red Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea—and argue that national and international action is needed to protect them from overfishing.},

              The loss of biodiversity is increasingly well understood on land, but trajectories of extinction risk remain largely unknown in the ocean. We present regional Red List Indices (RLIs) to track the extinction risk of 119 Northeast Atlantic and 72 Mediterranean shark and ray species primarily threatened by overfishing. We combine two IUCN workshop assessments from 2003/2005 and 2015 with a retrospective backcast assessment for 1980. We incorporate predicted categorisations for Data Deficient species from our previously published research. The percentage of threatened species rose from 1980 to 2015 from 29 to 41\% (Northeast Atlantic) and 47 to 65\% (Mediterranean Sea). There are as many threatened sharks and rays in Europe as there are threatened birds, but the threat level is nearly six times greater by percentage (41\%,

               = 56 of 136 vs. 7\%,
              n
               = 56 of 792). The Northeast Atlantic RLI declined by 8\% from 1980 to 2015, while the higher-risk Mediterranean RLI declined by 13\%. Larger-bodied, shallow-distributed, slow-growing species and those with range boundaries within the region are more likely to have worsening status in the Northeast Atlantic. Conversely, long-established, severe threat levels obscure any potential relationships between species’ traits and the likelihood of worsening IUCN status in the Mediterranean Sea. These regional RLIs provide the first widespread evidence for increasing trends in regional shark and ray extinction risk and underscore that effective fisheries management is necessary to recover the ecosystem function of these predators.},

Indicators of fish age and size-structures can hence be useful tools for fisheries- and environmental management. Size-based indicators have been tested and proposed for large, homogenous marine ecosystems with high fishing mortality, but rarely for fine-scaled heterogeneous ecosystems in coastal zones. Here we analyse a suite of size indicators for coastal fish communities in the Baltic Sea, including mean and median length, 10th and 90th-percentile of the length distribution (L10, L90), mean length of the 10\% largest fish (Lmax), large fish indices, size-spectra, and size-diversity. Results show good precision and accuracy of most indicators at realistic sample sizes, except for size-spectra and size-diversity, making them less suitable. Different indicators showed correlations among sites, indicating similar responses to environmental variation. Most size indicators responded positively to lower fishing pressure, especially indicators emphasizing the largest individuals in the population (e.g. L90 and Lmax), whereas eutrophication and physical disturbances had less impact. We conclude that size-based indicators aiming at describing the occurrence of larger fish, like L90 and Lmax, are useful for establishing management targets and assessing the status of coastal fish.},

However, they also predict faster juvenile growth rates and thus larger size-­at-­age of young organisms. Hence, the result of warming on the size-­structure of a population depends on the interplay between how mortality rate, juvenile- and adult growth rates are affected by warming. Here, we use two-d­ ecade long time series of biological samples from a unique enclosed bay heated by cooling water from a nearby nuclear power plant to become 5–10 °C warmer than its reference area. We used growth-­increment biochronologies (12,658 reconstructed length-­at-­age estimates from 2426 individuals) to quantify how {\textgreater}20 years of warming has affected body growth, size-­at-­age, and catch to quantify mortality rates and population size- and age structure of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis). In the heated area, growth rates were faster for all sizes, and hence size-­at-­age was larger for all ages, compared to the reference area. While mortality rates were also higher (lowering mean age by 0.4 years), the faster growth rates lead to a 2 cm larger mean size in the heated area. Differences in the size-s­ pectrum exponent (describing how the abundance declines with size) were less clear statistically. Our analyses reveal that mortality, in addition to plastic growth and size-­responses, is a key factor determining the size structure of populations exposed to warming. Understanding the mechanisms by which warming affects the size- and the age structure of populations is critical for predicting the impacts of climate change on ecological functions, interactions, and dynamics.},

This phenomenon, known as the temperature–size rule, has important consequences for global fisheries, whereby ocean warming is predicted to result in smaller fish and reduced biomass. However, the generality of this phenomenon and the mechanisms that drive it in natural populations remain unresolved. In this study, we document the maximal size of 74 fish species along a steep temperature gradient in the Mediterranean Sea and find strong support for the temperature–size rule. Importantly, we additionally find that size reduction in active fish species is dramatically larger than for more sedentary species. As the temperature dependence of oxygen consumption depends on activity levels, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxygen is a limiting factor shaping the temperature–size rule in fishes. These results suggest that ocean warming will result in a sharp, but uneven, reduction in fish size that will cause major shifts in size-dependent interactions. Moreover, warming will have major implications for fisheries as the main species targeted for harvesting will show the most substantial declines in biomass.},

	abstract = {Despite the prevalence and socioeconomic importance of small, low total-revenue stocks, predominantly in tropical, developing countries, most of the world’s fishery science effort has been devoted to large stocks. Methods for assessing and managing large stocks, though applicable to small ones, are seldom feasible for them. Minimal attention has been paid to approaches that are specifically for small stocks. The tendency for managers of fisheries on small stocks in developing countries to believe that stock assessment is essential for successful fishery management, often leads to disproportionate allocation of resources to stock assessment rather than other critical components of management. This has been reinforced by several agencies that have made stock assessment methods and software available for use in developing countries, while paying little attention to other dimensions of fishery assessment and management. Hence, management efforts for small stocks are often stock assessment driven (SAD), rather than management objective driven (MOD), as they should be. The sequence of actions typical of these two approaches is contrasted. Managers of small stocks in developing countries need international programs that will develop and promote formal methodological approaches with broad emphasis on management objectives and process.},

	abstract = {Scientists and resource managers need to know life history parameters (e.g., average mortality rate, individual growth rate, maximum length or mass, and timing of maturity) to understand and respond to risks to natural populations and ecosystems. For over 100 years, scientists have identified “life history invariants” (LHI) representing pairs of parameters whose ratio is theorized to be constant across species. LHI then promise to allow prediction of many parameters from field measurements of a few important traits. Using LHI in this way, however, neglects any residual patterns in parameters when making predictions. We therefore apply a multivariate model for eight variables (seven parameters and temperature) in over 32,000 fishes, and include taxonomic structure for residuals (with levels for class, order, family, genus, and species). We illustrate that this approach predicts variables probabilistically for taxa with many or few data. We then use this model to resolve three questions regarding life history parameters in fishes. Specifically we show that (1) on average there is a 1.24\% decrease in the Brody growth coefficient for every 1\% increase in maximum size; (2) the ratio of natural mortality rate and growth coefficient is not an LHI but instead varies systematically based on the timing of maturation, where movement along this life history axis is predictably correlated with species taxonomy; and (3) three variables must be known per species to precisely predict remaining life history variables. We distribute our predictive model as an R package, FishLife, to allow future life history predictions for fishes to be conditioned on taxonomy and life history data for fishes worldwide. This package also contains predictions (and predictive intervals) for mortality, maturity, size, and growth parameters for all described fishes.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Organismal responses to climate change are mediated through its effects on physiology and metabolism. In aquatic environments, both water temperature and oxygen availability may modulate these responses by altering the aerobic metabolism fueling physiological performance. However, ecological models aimed at predicting how environmental factors shape aerobic metabolism disregard the role of oxygen supply. Here, we expand on these models by explicitly incorporating oxygen supply. Our results show that warmer water increases oxygen demand relative to supply, and the resulting reduction in aerobic scope appears to be stronger in larger individuals. Smaller aerobic scopes in warming water imply that climate change will reduce energy budgets needed to support the activities of aquatic animals and their physiological performance in the future.
          , 
            Both oxygen and temperature are fundamental factors determining metabolic performance, fitness, ecological niches, and responses of many aquatic organisms to climate change. Despite the importance of physical and physiological constraints on oxygen supply affecting aerobic metabolism of aquatic ectotherms, ecological theories such as the metabolic theory of ecology have focused on the effects of temperature rather than oxygen. This gap currently impedes mechanistic models from accurately predicting metabolic rates (i.e., oxygen consumption rates) of aquatic organisms and restricts predictions to resting metabolism, which is less affected by oxygen limitation. Here, we expand on models of metabolic scaling by accounting for the role of oxygen availability and temperature on both resting and active metabolic rates. Our model predicts that oxygen limitation is more likely to constrain metabolism in larger, warmer, and active fish. Consequently, active metabolic rates are less responsive to temperature than are resting metabolic rates, and metabolism scales to body size with a smaller exponent whenever temperatures or activity levels are higher. Results from a metaanalysis of fish metabolic rates are consistent with our model predictions. The observed interactive effects of temperature, oxygen availability, and body size predict that global warming will limit the aerobic scope of aquatic ectotherms and may place a greater metabolic burden on larger individuals, impairing their physiological performance in the future. Our model reconciles the metabolic theory with empirical observations of oxygen limitation and provides a formal, quantitative framework for predicting both resting and active metabolic rate and hence aerobic scope of aquatic ectotherms.},

	abstract = {Large-scale spatial heterogeneity in fisheries production is predominantly controlled by the availability of zooplankton and benthic organisms, which have a complex relationship with primary production. To investigate how cross-ecosystem differences in these drivers determine fish assemblages and productivity, we constructed a spatially explicit mechanistic model of three fish functional types: forage, large pelagic, and demersal fishes. The model is based on allometric scaling principles, includes basic life cycle transitions, and has trophic interactions between the fishes and with their pelagic and benthic food resources. The model was applied to the global ocean, with plankton food web estimates and ocean conditions from a high-resolution earth system model. Further, a simple representation of fishing was included, and led to moderate matches with total, large pelagic, and demersal catches, including re-creation of observed variations in fish catch spanning two orders of magnitude. Our results highlight several ecologically meaningful model sensitivities. First, coexistence between forage and large pelagic fish in productive regions occurred when forage fish survival is promoted via both favorable metabolic allometry and enhanced predator avoidance in adult forage fish. Second, the prominence of demersal fish is highly sensitive to the efficiency of energy transfer to benthic invertebrates. Third, the latitudinal distribution of the total catch is modulated by the temperature dependence of metabolic rates, with increased sensitivity pushing fish biomass toward the poles. Fourth, forage fish biomass is suppressed by strong top-down controls on temperate and subpolar shelves, where mixed assemblages of large pelagic and demersal fishes exerted high predation rates. Last, spatial differences in the dominance of large pelagics vs. demersals is strongly related to the ratio of pelagic zooplankton production to benthic production. We discuss the potential linkages between model misfits and unresolved processes including movement, spawning phenology, seabird and marine mammal predators, and socioeconomically driven fishing pressure, which are identified as priorities for future model development. Ultimately, the model and analyses herein are intended as a baseline for a robust, mechanistic tool to understand, quantify, and predict global fish biomass and yield, now and in a future dominated by climate change and improved fishing technology.},

            Under climate change, model ensembles suggest that declines in phytoplankton biomass amplify into greater reductions at higher trophic levels, with serious implications for fisheries and carbon storage. However, the extent and mechanisms of this trophic amplification vary greatly among models, and validation is problematic. In situ size spectra offer a novel alternative, comparing biomass of small and larger organisms to quantify the net efficiency of energy transfer through natural food webs that are already challenged with multiple climate change stressors. Our global compilation of pelagic size spectrum slopes supports trophic amplification empirically, independently from model simulations. Thus, even a modest (16\%) decline in phytoplankton this century would magnify into a 38\% decline in supportable biomass of fish within the intensively-fished mid-latitude ocean. We also show that this amplification stems not from thermal controls on consumers, but mainly from temperature or nutrient controls that structure the phytoplankton baseline of the food web. The lack of evidence for direct thermal effects on size structure contrasts with most current thinking, based often on more acute stress experiments or shorter-timescale responses. Our synthesis of size spectra integrates these short-term dynamics, revealing the net efficiency of food webs acclimating and adapting to climatic stressors.},

	abstract = {Researchers have long recognized the importance of ecological differences at the species level in structuring natural communities yet until recently have often overlooked the inﬂuence of intraspeciﬁc trait variation, which can profoundly alter community dynamics [1]. Human extraction of living resources can reduce intraspeciﬁc trait variation by, for example, causing truncation of age and size structure of populations, where numbers of older individuals decline far more with exploitation than younger individuals. Age truncation can negatively affect population and community stability, increasing variability in population and community biomass [2–6], reducing productivity [7–10] and life-history diversity in traits such as the spatial and temporal pattern of reproduction and migration [4, 11–16]. Here, we quantiﬁed the extent of age truncation in 63 ﬁshed populations across ﬁve ocean regions, as measured by how much the proportions of ﬁsh in the oldest age groups declined over time. The proportion of individuals in the oldest age classes decreased signiﬁcantly in 79\% to 97\% of populations (compared to historical or unﬁshed values, respectively), and the magnitude of decline was greater than 90\% in 32\% to 41\% of populations. The pervasiveness and intensity of age truncation indicates that ﬁshing is likely reducing the stability of many marine communities. Our ﬁndings suggest that more emphasis should be given to management measures that reduce the impact of ﬁshing on age truncation, including no-take areas, slot limits that prohibit ﬁshing on all except a narrow range of ﬁsh sizes, and rotational harvesting.},

            Tropical ectotherms are hypothesized to be vulnerable to environmental changes, but cascading effects of organismal tolerances on the assembly and functioning of reef fish communities are largely unknown. Here, we examine differences in organismal traits, assemblage structure, and productivity of cryptobenthic reef fishes between the world’s hottest, most extreme coral reefs in the southern Arabian Gulf and the nearby, but more environmentally benign, Gulf of Oman. We show that assemblages in the Arabian Gulf are half as diverse and less than 25\% as abundant as in the Gulf of Oman, despite comparable benthic composition and live coral cover. This pattern appears to be driven by energetic deficiencies caused by responses to environmental extremes and distinct prey resource availability rather than absolute thermal tolerances. As a consequence, production, transfer, and replenishment of biomass through cryptobenthic fish assemblages is greatly reduced on Earth’s hottest coral reefs. Extreme environmental conditions, as predicted for the end of the 21st century, could thus disrupt the community structure and productivity of a critical functional group, independent of live coral loss.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic habitats are increasingly prevalent in coastal marine environments. Previous research on sessile epifauna suggests that artificial habitats act as a refuge for nonindigenous species, which results in highly homogenous communities across locations. However, vertebrate assemblages that live in association with artificial habitats are poorly understood. Here, we quantify the biodiversity of small, cryptic (henceforth “cryptobenthic”) fishes from marine dock pilings across six locations over 35° of latitude from Maine to Panama. We also compare assemblages from dock pilings to natural habitats in the two southernmost locations (Panama and Belize). Our results suggest that the biodiversity patterns of cryptobenthic fishes from dock pilings follow a Latitudinal Diversity Gradient (LDG), with average local and regional diversity declining sharply with increasing latitude. Furthermore, a strong correlation between community composition and spatial distance suggests distinct regional assemblages of cryptobenthic fishes. Cryptobenthic fish assemblages from dock pilings in Belize and Panama were less diverse and had lower densities than nearby reef habitats. However, dock pilings harbored almost exclusively native species, including two species of conservation concern absent from nearby natural habitats. Our results suggest that, in contrast to sessile epifaunal assemblages on artificial substrates, artificial marine habitats can harbor diverse, regionally characteristic assemblages of vertebrates that follow macroecological patterns that are well documented for natural habitats. We therefore posit that, although dock pilings cannot function as a replacement for natural habitats, dock pilings may provide cost-­effective means to preserve native vertebrate biodiversity, and provide a habitat that can be relatively easily monitored to track the status and trends of fish biodiversity in highly urbanized coastal marine environments.},

Major ecological axes relevant to phytoplankton include light and nutrient acquisition and use, natural enemy interactions, morphological variation, temperature sensitivity, and modes of reproduction. Tradeoffs between these traits play key roles in determining community structure. Freshwater and marine environments may select for a different suite of traits owing to their different physical and chemical properties.

This neglects the spatial dynamics between groups of different body size (body size groups), that fundamentally shapes the spatial structure of a population. Here, we explored the mechanisms that modulate spatial dynamics of body size groups, and applied our analyses to three North Sea fish populations which experienced severe declines in biomass from 1977 to 2019: Atlantic cod
              Gadus morhua

              . All three populations exhibited strong declines in the overlapped area between body size groups in winter over 43 years, yet their mechanisms differed. These declines were either due to 1) different magnitudes of contraction of the distribution area of body size groups; and/or 2) different speeds and directions of spatial shift among various body size groups, both increasing spatial segregation within populations. These patterns were either associated with ocean warming, and/or declining population biomass, and such associations often varied according to distinct body size groups. Increasing spatial segregation between size groups of a population likely hampers life‐cycle connectivity and stability to local perturbations. Our analytical approach provides a powerful tool for identifying vulnerable populations under environmental stress and can be generalized to study a variety of size/age structured populations at various ecosystem types.},

However, this equilibrium assumption is likely violated in almost every ﬁshery, degrading estimation performance. We developed an extension of length-only approaches to account for time-varying recruitment and ﬁshing mortality. This Length-based Integrated Mixed Effects (LIME) method at a minimum requires a single year of length data and basic biological information but can ﬁt to multiple years of length data, catch, and an abundance index if available. We use simulation testing to demonstrate that LIME can estimate how much ﬁshing has reduced spawning output in the most recent year across a variety of scenarios for recruitment and ﬁshing mortality. LIME improves data-limited ﬁsheries stock assessments by its ﬂexibility to incorporate additional years or types of data if available and obviates the need for equilibrium assumptions.},

	abstract = {The concept of oxygen- and capacity-dependent thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained climateinduced effects of rising temperatures on species abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress, caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope. Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on a limited temperature range results from temperaturedependent trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors like CO2 (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual analysis suggests that the relationships between energy turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus, community responses at the ecosystem level.},

For a cause and effect analysis the present paper discusses those physiological processes limiting thermal tolerance. The lower heat tolerance in metazoa compared with unicellular eukaryotes and bacteria suggests that a complex systemic rather than molecular process is limiting in metazoa. Whole-animal aerobic scope appears as the first process limited at low and high temperatures, linked to the progressively insufficient capacity of circulation and ventilation. Oxygen levels in body fluids may decrease, reflecting excessive oxygen demand at high temperatures or insufficient aerobic capacity of mitochondria at low temperatures. Aerobic scope falls at temperatures beyond the thermal optimum and vanishes at low or high critical temperatures when transition to an anaerobic mitochondrial metabolism occurs. The adjustment of mitochondrial densities on top of parallel molecular or membrane adjustments appears crucial for maintaining aerobic scope and for shifting thermal tolerance. In conclusion, the capacity of oxygen delivery matches full aerobic scope only within the thermal optimum. At temperatures outside this range, only time-limited survival is supported by residual aerobic scope, then anaerobic metabolism and finally molecular protection by heat shock proteins and antioxidative defence. In a cause and effect hierarchy, the progressive increase in oxygen limitation at extreme temperatures may even enhance oxidative and denaturation stress. As a corollary, capacity limitations at a complex level of organisation, the oxygen delivery system, define thermal tolerance limits before molecular functions become disturbed.},

	abstract = {Body size is central to ecology at levels ranging from organismal fecundity to the functioning of communities and ecosystems. Understanding temperature-induced variations in body size is therefore of fundamental and applied interest, yet thermal responses of body size remain poorly understood. Temperature–size (T–S) responses tend to be negative (e.g. smaller body size at maturity when reared under warmer conditions), which has been termed the temperature–size rule (TSR). Explanations emphasize either physiological mechanisms (e.g. limitation of oxygen or other resources and temperature-dependent resource allocation) or the adaptive value of either a large body size (e.g. to increase fecundity) or a short development time (e.g. in response to increased mortality in warm conditions). Oxygen limitation could act as a proximate factor, but we suggest it more likely constitutes a selective pressure to reduce body size in the warm: risks of oxygen limitation will be reduced as a consequence of evolution eliminating genotypes more prone to oxygen limitation. Thus, T–S responses can be explained by the ‘Ghost of Oxygen-limitation Past’, whereby the resulting (evolved) T–S responses safeguard sufﬁcient oxygen provisioning under warmer conditions, reﬂecting the balance between oxygen supply and demands experienced by ancestors. T–S responses vary considerably across species, but some of this variation is predictable. Body-size reductions with warming are stronger in aquatic taxa than in terrestrial taxa. We discuss whether larger aquatic taxa may especially face greater risks of oxygen limitation as they grow, which may be manifested at the cellular level, the level of the gills and the whole-organism level. In contrast to aquatic species, terrestrial ectotherms may be less prone to oxygen limitation and prioritize early maturity over large size, likely because overwintering is more challenging, with concomitant stronger end-of season time constraints. Mechanisms related to time constraints and oxygen limitation are not mutually exclusive explanations for the TSR. Rather, these and other mechanisms may operate in tandem. But their relative importance may vary depending on the ecology and physiology of the species in question, explaining not only the general tendency of negative T–S responses but also variation in T–S responses among animals differing in mode of respiration (e.g. water breathers versus air breathers), genome size, voltinism and thermally associated behaviour (e.g. heliotherms).},

                  Accumulating evidence suggests that the average body size of many organisms is declining in response to climate warming. This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services.
                
                
                  However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99\% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate.
                
                
                  This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems.
                
                
                  Warming‐induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size‐dependent feedbacks at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems.
                
                
                  Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi‐natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time‐series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels.
                
                
                  Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate.

However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how growth and key processes affecting it, such as consumption and metabolism, depend on both temperature and body mass within species. This limits our ability to inform growth models, link experimental data to observed growth patterns, and advance mechanistic food web models. To examine the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual growth, as well as the link between maximum consumption, metabolism, and body growth, we conducted a systematic review and compiled experimental data on fishes from 52 studies that combined body mass and temperature treatments. By fitting hierarchical models accounting for variation between species, we estimated how maximum consumption and metabolic rate scale jointly with temperature and body mass within species. We found that whole-­organism maximum consumption increases more slowly with body mass than metabolism, and is unimodal over the full temperature range, which leads to the prediction that optimum growth temperatures decline with body size. Using an independent dataset, we confirmed this negative relationship between optimum growth temperature and body size. Small individuals of a given population may, therefore, exhibit increased growth with initial warming, whereas larger conspecifics could be the first to experience negative impacts of warming on growth. These findings help advance mechanistic models of individual growth and food web dynamics and improve our understanding of how climate warming affects the growth and size structure of aquatic ectotherms.},

	abstract = {Upper thermal limits (CTmax) are frequently used to parameterize the fundamental niche of ectothermic animals and to infer biogeographical distribution limits under current and future climate scenarios. However, there is considerable debate associated with the methodological, ecological and physiological definitions of CTmax. The recent (re)introduction of the thermal death time (TDT) model has reconciled some of these issues and now offers a solid mathematical foundation to model CTmax by considering both intensity and duration of thermal stress. Nevertheless, the physiological origin and boundaries of this temperature–duration model remain unexplored. Supported by empirical data, we here outline a reconciling framework that integrates the TDT model, which operates at stressful temperatures, with the classic thermal performance curve (TPC) that typically describes biological functions at permissive temperatures. Further, we discuss how the TDT model is founded on a balance between disruptive and regenerative biological processes that ultimately defines a critical boundary temperature (Tc) separating the TDT and TPC models. Collectively, this framework allows inclusion of both repair and accumulation of heat stress, and therefore also offers a consistent conceptual approach to understand the impact of high temperature under fluctuating thermal conditions. Further, this reconciling framework allows improved experimental designs to understand the physiological underpinnings and ecological consequences of ectotherm heat tolerance.},

We summarize the opportunities and challenges for extending this approach to understanding the consequences of extreme climatic events. Using statistical tools from extreme value theory, we show how distributions of thermal extremes vary with latitude, time scale and climate change. Second, we review how performance curves and tolerances have been used to predict the fitness and evolutionary responses to climate change and climate gradients. Performance curves and tolerances change with prior thermal history and with time scale, complicating their use for predicting responses to thermal extremes. Third, we describe several recent case studies showing how infrequent extreme events can have outsized effects on the evolution of performance curves and heat tolerance. A key issue is whether thermal extremes affect reproduction or survival, and how these combine to determine overall fitness. We argue that a greater focus on tails—in the distribution of environmental extremes, and in the upper ends of performance curves—is needed to understand the consequences of extreme events.

                  Growth rates directly influence individual fitness and constrain the flow of energy within food webs. Determining what factors alter the energetic cost of growth is therefore fundamental to ecological and evolutionary models.
                
                
                  
                    Here, we used theory to derive predictions about how the cost of growth varies over ontogeny and with temperature. We tested these predictions by measuring resting oxygen consumption and growth rates of zebrafish (
                    Danio rerio
                    ) at four temperature treatments (20°C, 26°C, 29°C, 32°C). We calibrated oxygen consumption for ATP production by measuring the efficiency of mitochondria (P/O ratios) at the end of the experiment.
                  
                
                
                  We show that, when compared to growth rates, rates of resting oxygen consumption exhibited a significantly higher temperature dependence and significantly lower mass scaling. P/O ratios varied substantially among individuals, but did not account for the observed difference in temperature dependence between rates. Consequently, the cost of growth was significantly higher at earlier ontogenetic stages, and it increased twofold between 20°C and 32°C. Temperature systematically decreased the size of adults between 26°C and 32°C.
                
                
                  To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first attempt to characterise how the cost of growth varies over ontogeny and across temperatures in a model vertebrate. Rising temperatures will substantially alter the structure of ecosystems and the distribution of biomass in food webs because they drive a decline in the average size of individuals, and because higher costs of growth lead to inefficient energy transfer between trophic levels.

	abstract = {For at least 200 years, since the time of Malthus, population growth has been recognized as providing a critical link between the performance of individual organisms and the ecology and evolution of species. We present a theory that shows how the intrinsic rate of exponential population growth, rmax, and the carrying capacity, K, depend on individual metabolic rate and resource supply rate. To do this, we construct equations for the metabolic rates of entire populations by summing over individuals, and then we combine these population-level equations with Malthusian growth. Thus, the theory makes explicit the relationship between rates of resource supply in the environment and rates of production of new biomass and individuals. These individual-level and population-level processes are inextricably linked because metabolism sets both the demand for environmental resources and the resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction. We use the theory to make explicit how and why rmax exhibits its characteristic dependence on body size and temperature. Data for aerobic eukaryotes, including algae, protists, insects, zooplankton, ﬁshes, and mammals, support these predicted scalings for rmax. The metabolic ﬂux of energy and materials also dictates that the carrying capacity or equilibrium density of populations should decrease with increasing body size and increasing temperature. Finally, we argue that body mass and body temperature, through their effects on metabolic rate, can explain most of the variation in fecundity and mortality rates. Data for marine ﬁshes in the ﬁeld support these predictions for instantaneous rates of mortality. This theory links the rates of metabolism and resource use of individuals to life-history attributes and population dynamics for a broad assortment of organisms, from unicellular organisms to mammals.},

Here, we conducted an analysis of the size structure of these benthic and demersal communities in the northern and southern zones of the CCS. Sampling was conducted onboard shrimp trawlers throughout an entire year. No significant differences were found in the size distributions of the two zones, among sites within southern ecoregions, or among the analyzed cruises. This homogeneity in size structure is remarkable since the zones analyzed possess very different species compositions and environmental conditions. The observed size structures were adequately described by non-linear distributions rather than the traditionally employed linear normalized biomass size spectra. It is hypothesized that the non-linearity is due to the effect of fishing and particularly, of discarding. This study emphasizes the need for a greater understanding of the impacts that trawl fishing has on community size structure and the applicability of this knowledge towards fishery resource management in ecosystems with high diversity.},

Pigs (Sus scrofa), goats (Capra hircus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) denuded the island so severely that massive amounts of soil and underlying substrate were lost through erosion. Rabbits, the last of these exotic animals to be removed, were eradicated during the 1980’s. Since then the extent of vegetation on the island has been increasing by natural revegetation and through plantings and seeding. Fourteen species of seabird currently breed on Phillip Island. Five species—Providence petrel (Pterodroma solandri), Kermadec petrel (P. neglecta), white-naped petrel (P. cervicalis), flesh-footed shearwater (Puffinus carneipes) and red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda)—all have ecologically significant populations. In this paper, we review the current status of the seabird populations breeding on Phillip Island, and suggest how vegetation restoration is likely to affect each species. We update previously published notes and present unpublished material collected by us over more than 3 decades.

For the marine realm, the generality of this pattern has frequently been questioned. Here, I use a database with nearly 600 published gradients (198 of which were marine) to assess whether there is a marine latitudinal diversity gradient of similar average strength and slope as that for terrestrial organisms. Using meta-analysis techniques, I also tested which characteristics of organisms or habitats affected gradient strength and slope. The overall strength and slope of the gradient for marine organisms was significantly negative and of similar magnitude compared to gradients for terrestrial organisms. Marine gradients were on average stronger as well as steeper than freshwater gradients. Latitudinal gradients were clearly a regional phenomenon, with stronger gradients and steeper slopes for diversity assessed on regional than on local scales. The gradient parameters differed also between oceans and between different habitats, with steeper gradients related to the pelagial rather than the benthos. There were on the other hand no significant differences between hemispheres and between different gradient ranges, although such differences have often been presumed. The most important organismal characteristic related to gradient structure was body mass, with significant gradients related to large organisms. A significant increase in gradient strength with increasing trophic level was observed. The meta-analysis also revealed strongest gradients for nekton and mobile epifauna, whereas the gradients were weak for sessile epifauna and for infauna. In conclusion, marine biota reveal a similar overall decline in diversity with latitude to that observed in terrestrial realms, but the strength and slope of the gradient are clearly subject to regional, habitat and organismal features.},

This is often undertaken by reporting stock status relative to limit reference points (LRP). Reporting against LRP is effective in drawing attention to stocks that are overfished but does not identify fisheries where performance could be improved by shifting stocks closer to target reference points (TRP), that is, benefit can be foregone despite stocks being fished sustainably. This study examined the performance of Australian fish stocks against a TRP of 40–60\% of unfished biomass, the level at which economic performance is generally optimised. Stocks examined were drawn from the 2016 Status of Australian Fish Stocks report, which is designed to report on stock status relative to LRP at a national level. Only stocks with an estimate of biomass or status relative to explicitly defined reference points were considered. Of 123 stocks evaluated, 41 (33\%) were at target biomass levels, 28\% were above and 39\% below. This result, in combination with the major output of the 2016 SAFS report, shows that although most Australian stocks are not overfished, many are outside levels that would deliver greatest benefits. While maintaining all stocks at target levels may be impractical given the dynamic nature of fisheries, failing to maximise the number of stocks at target levels reflects lost ecological, economic and social potential. Assessing stocks relative to TRP in addition to LRP would highlight opportunities for improving fisheries while still addressing the fundamental requirement of preventing stock depletion.},

            Climate change is a complex global issue that is driving countless shifts in the structure and function of marine ecosystems. To better understand these shifts, many processes need to be considered, yet they are often approached from incompatible perspectives. This article reviews one relatively simple, integrated perspective: the abundance-size spectrum. We introduce the topic with a brief review of some of the ways climate change is expected to impact the marine ecosystem according to complex numerical models while acknowledging the limits to understanding posed by complex models. We then review how the size spectrum offers a simple conceptual alternative, given its regular power law size-frequency distribution when viewed on sufficiently broad scales. We further explore how anticipated physical aspects of climate change might manifest themselves through changes in the elevation, slope and regularity of the size spectrum, exposing mechanistic questions about integrated ecosystem structure, as well as how organism physiology and ecological interactions respond to multiple climatic stressors. Despite its application by ecosystem modellers and fisheries scientists, the size spectrum perspective is not widely used as a tool for monitoring ecosystem adaptation to climate change, providing a major opportunity for further research.},

In this study, we fit size spectra to field data from 45 rocky and coral reef sites along a 28° latitudinal gradient, comprising individuals from 0.125 mm to 2 m in body size. We found that 96\% of the variation in abundance along this ‘extended’ size gradient was described by a single linear function across all sites. However, consistent ‘wobbles’ were also observed, with subtle peaks and troughs in abundance along the spectrum, which varied with sea temperature, as predicted by theory relating to trophic cascades.},

Although this community structure has been observed regionally, mostly among plankton groups, its generality has never been formally tested across all marine life over the global ocean, nor have the impacts of humans on it been globally assessed. Here, we bring together data at the global scale to test the hypothesis from bacteria to whales. We find that biomass within most order of magnitude size classes is indeed remarkably constant, near 1 gigatonne (Gt) wet weight (10
              15
              g), but bacteria and large marine mammals are markedly above and below this value, respectively. Furthermore, human impacts appear to have significantly truncated the upper one-third of the spectrum. This dramatic alteration to what is possibly life’s largest-scale regularity underscores the global extent of human activities.},

              INTRODUCTION
              A surprisingly general pattern at very large scales casts light on the link between ecosystem structure and function. We show a robust scaling law that emerges uniquely at the level of whole ecosystems and is conserved across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. This pattern describes the changing structure and productivity of the predator-prey biomass pyramid, which represents the biomass of communities at different levels of the food chain. Scaling exponents of the relation between predator versus prey biomass and community production versus biomass are often near ¾, which indicates that very different communities of species exhibit similar high-level structure and function. This recurrent community growth pattern is remarkably similar to individual growth patterns and may hint at a basic process that reemerges across levels of organization.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              We assembled a global data set for community biomass and production across 2260 large mammal, invertebrate, plant, and plankton communities. These data reveal two ecosystem-level power law scaling relations: (i) predator biomass versus prey biomass, which indicates how the biomass pyramid changes shape, and (ii) community production versus community biomass, which indicates how per capita productivity changes at a given level in the pyramid. Both relations span a wide range of ecosystems along large-scale biomass gradients. These relations can be linked theoretically to show how pyramid shape depends on flux rates into and out of predator-prey communities. In order to link community-level patterns to individual processes, we examined community size structure and, particularly, how the mean body mass of a community relates to its biomass.
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                Across ecosystems globally, pyramid structure becomes consistently more bottom-heavy, and per capita production declines with increasing biomass. These two ecosystem-level patterns both follow power laws with near ¾ exponents and are shown to be robust to different methods and assumptions. These structural and functional relations are linked theoretically, suggesting that a common community-growth pattern influences predator-prey interactions and underpins pyramid shape. Several of these patterns are highly regular (

                2
                {\textgreater} 0.80) and yet are unexpected from classic theories or from empirical relations at the population or individual level. By examining community size structure, we show these patterns emerge distinctly at the ecosystem level and independently from individual near ¾ body-mass allometries.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Systematic changes in biomass and production across trophic communities link fundamental aspects of ecosystem structure and function. The striking similarities that are observed across different kinds of systems imply a process that does not depend on system details. The regularity of many of these relations allows large-scale predictions and suggests high-level organization. This community-level growth pattern suggests a systematic form of density-dependent growth and is intriguing given the parallels it exhibits to growth scaling at the individual level, both of which independently follow near ¾ exponents. Although we can make ecosystem-level predictions from individual-level data, we have yet to fully understand this similarity, which may offer insight into growth processes in physiology and ecology across the tree of life.

            Ecosystems exhibit surprising regularities in structure and function across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near ¾. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory.},

Whilst LMMs offer a ﬂexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the ﬁtting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Improved understanding of this degradation is urgently needed to improve avoidance and mitigation measures. One tool to assist these efforts is predictive models of ecosystem structure and function that are mechanistic: based on fundamental ecological principles. Here we present the first mechanistic General Ecosystem Model (GEM) of ecosystem structure and function that is both global and applies in all terrestrial and marine environments. Functional forms and parameter values were derived from the theoretical and empirical literature where possible. Simulations of the fate of all organisms with body masses between 10 mg and 150,000 kg (a range of 14 orders of magnitude) across the globe led to emergent properties at individual (e.g., growth rate), community (e.g., biomass turnover rates), ecosystem (e.g., trophic pyramids), and macroecological scales (e.g., global patterns of trophic structure) that are in general agreement with current data and theory. These properties emerged from our encoding of the biology of, and interactions among, individual organisms without any direct constraints on the properties themselves. Our results indicate that ecologists have gathered sufficient information to begin to build realistic, global, and mechanistic models of ecosystems, capable of predicting a diverse range of ecosystem properties and their response to human pressures.},

            Demonstrating asymmetric competition in natural systems is difficult, as the effect of large individuals on small ones has to be measured, and vice versa. Numerous experiments have quantified one side of the interaction, typically the effect of large individuals on small ones. Here, we demonstrate, using a long-term study of guppies, that an individual’s performance depends on its relative size, with large individuals being competitively dominant. Accurate prediction of both the mean and variance in body size was possible by using models incorporating asymmetric competition, whereas in models where individuals are competitively equivalent, the predictions were poor.
          , 
            Biotic interactions are central to both ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In the vast majority of empirical studies, the strength of intraspecific interactions is estimated by using simple measures of population size. Biologists have long known that these are crude metrics, with experiments and theory suggesting that interactions between individuals should depend on traits, such as body size. Despite this, it has been difficult to estimate the impact of traits on competitive ability from ecological field data, and this explains why the strength of biotic interactions has empirically been treated in a simplistic manner. Using long-term observational data from four different populations, we show that large Trinidadian guppies impose a significantly larger competitive pressure on conspecifics than individuals that are smaller; in other words, competition is asymmetric. When we incorporate this asymmetry into integral projection models, the predicted size structure is much closer to what we see in the field compared with models where competition is independent of body size. This difference in size structure translates into a twofold difference in reproductive output. This demonstrates how the nature of ecological interactions drives the size structure, which, in turn, will have important implications for both the ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

	abstract = {Benthic–pelagic coupling is manifested as the exchange of energy, mass, or nutrients between benthic and pelagic habitats. It plays a prominent role in aquatic ecosystems, and it is crucial to functions from nutrient cycling to energy transfer in food webs. Coastal and estuarine ecosystem structure and function are strongly affected by anthropogenic pressures; however, there are large gaps in our understanding of the responses of inorganic nutrient and organic matter ﬂuxes between benthic habitats and the water column. We illustrate the varied nature of physical and biological benthic–pelagic coupling processes and their potential sensitivity to three anthropogenic pressures – climate change, nutrient loading, and ﬁshing – using the Baltic Sea as a case study and summarize current knowledge on the exchange of inorganic nutrients and organic material between habitats. Traditionally measured benthic–pelagic coupling processes (e.g., nutrient exchange and sedimentation of organic material) are to some extent quantiﬁable, but the magnitude and variability of biological processes are rarely assessed, preventing quantitative comparisons. Changing oxygen conditions will continue to have widespread effects on the processes that govern inorganic and organic matter exchange among habitats while climate change and nutrient load reductions may have large effects on organic matter sedimentation. Many biological processes (predation, bioturbation) are expected to be sensitive to anthropogenic drivers, but the outcomes for ecosystem function are largely unknown. We emphasize how improved empirical and experimental understanding of benthic–pelagic coupling processes and their variability are necessary to inform models that can quantify the feedbacks among processes and ecosystem responses to a changing world.},

Increasing percentage hard substrate and the number of small reef holes increased fish abundance on reefs. The observed number of species (Sobs) occurring on each reef increased with increasing rugosity, variety of growth forms, percentage hard substrate, and variety of refuge hole sizes. A rarefied or abundance-corrected species richness measure (Srare) was calculated to take the varying fish abundances into account. After this correction, rugosity was the only variable that significantly increased fish species-richness. Experimental reefs of different height (20 and 60 cm) did not have significantly different fish abundance or species richness. The presence of long-spined sea urchins Diadema antillarum increased Sobs and total fish abundance on artificial rock-reefs and in seagrass beds, but the effect was most pronounced in seagrass beds where shelter was a strongly limiting factor. These results indicate that complex habitats or animals such as D. antillarum that provide shelter to fish are essential for maintaining fish biodiversity at local scales. The most important aspects of complexity are rugosity, hard substrate and small refuge holes. Artificial reefs may be used to mitigate habitat damage in impacted areas, and if management objectives are to increase local fish abundance and species richness, the reefs should provide a stable substrate where this is unavailable, have a rugose surface with many small refuge holes, and have a variety of growth forms.},

	abstract = {Recent episodes of coral bleaching have led to wide-scale loss of reef corals and raised concerns over the effectiveness of existing conservation and management efforts. The 1998 bleaching event was most severe in the western Indian Ocean, where coral declined by up to 90\% in some locations. Using fisheries-independent data, we assessed the long-term impacts of this event on fishery target species in the Seychelles, the overall size structure of the fish assemblage, and the effectiveness of two marine protected areas (MPAs) in protecting fish communities. The biomass of fished species above the size retained in fish traps changed little between 1994 and 2005, indicating no current effect on fishery yields. Biomass remained higher in MPAs, indicating they were effective in protecting fish stocks. Nevertheless, the size structure of the fish communities, as described with size-spectra analysis, changed in both fished areas and MPAs, with a decline in smaller fish ({\textless}30 cm) and an increase in larger fish ({\textgreater}45 cm). We believe this represents a time-lag response to a reduction in reef structural complexity brought about because fishes are being lost through natural mortality and fishing, and are not being replaced by juveniles. This effect is expected to be greater in terms of fisheries productivity and, because congruent patterns are observed for herbivores, suggests that MPAs do not offer coral reefs long-term resilience to bleaching events. Corallivores and planktivores declined strikingly in abundance, particularly in MPAs, and this decline was associated with a similar pattern of decline in their preferred corals. We suggest that climate-mediated disturbances, such as coral bleaching, be at the fore of conservation planning for coral reefs.},

Size-spectra, relationships between abundance and body-size class, regardless of taxonomy, can be calculated from simple sizeabundance data. Both the slope and the mid-point height of the relationship can be compared at diﬀerent ﬁshing intensities. Here, we develop size-spectra for reef ﬁsh assemblages using body size- abundance data collected by underwater visual census in each of ten ﬁshing grounds across a known gradient of ﬁshing intensity in the Kadavu Island group, Fiji. Slopes of the size-spectra became steeper (F9,69=3.20, p{\textless}0.01) and the height declined (F9,69=15.78, p{\textless}0.001) with increasing ﬁshing intensity. Regressions of numbers of individuals per size class across grounds were negative for all size classes, although the slope was almost zero for the smallest size class. Response to exploitation of each size class category was greatest for larger ﬁsh. Steepening of the slope with increasing ﬁshing intensity largely resulted from reductions in the relative abundance of large ﬁsh and not from the ecological release of small ﬁsh following depletion of their predators. The slope and height of the size-spectrum appear to be good indicators of ﬁshing eﬀects on reef ﬁsh assemblages.},

	abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category±subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-toindividual ratios). Rarefaction methods ± both sample-based and individual-based ± allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

	abstract = {In this article, we present a self-contained review of recent work on complex biological systems which exhibit no characteristic scale. This property can manifest itself with fractals (spatial scale invariance), ﬂicker noise or 1{\textbackslash}f-noise where f denotes the frequency of a signal (temporal scale invariance) and power laws (scale invariance in the size and duration of events in the dynamics of the system). A hypothesis recently put forward to explain these scale-free phenomomena is criticality, a notion introduced by physicists while studying phase transitions in materials, where systems spontaneously arrange themselves in an unstable manner similar, for instance, to a row of dominoes. Here, we review in a critical manner work which investigates to what extent this idea can be generalized to biology. More precisely, we start with a brief introduction to the concepts of absence of characteristic scale (power-law distributions, fractals and 1{\textbackslash}fnoise) and of critical phenomena. We then review typical mathematical models exhibiting such properties : edge of chaos, cellular automata and self-organized critical models. These notions are then brought together to see to what extent they can account for the scale invariance observed in ecology, evolution of species, type III epidemics and some aspects of the central nervous system. This article also discusses how the notion of scale invariance can give important insights into the workings of biological systems.},

	abstract = {The size of an organism matters for its metabolic, growth, mortality, and other vital rates. Scale-free community size spectra (i.e., size distributions regardless of species) are routinely observed in natural ecosystems and are the product of intra- and interspecies regulation of the relative abundance of organisms of different sizes. Intra- and interspecies distributions of body sizes are thus major determinants of ecosystems’ structure and function. We show experimentally that single-species mass distributions of unicellular eukaryotes covering different phyla exhibit both characteristic sizes and universal features over more than four orders of magnitude in mass. Remarkably, we find that the mean size of a species is sufficient to characterize its size distribution fully and that the latter has a universal form across all species. We show that an analytical physiological model accounts for the observed universality, which can be synthesized in a log-normal form for the intraspecies size distributions. We also propose how ecological and physiological processes should interact to produce scale-invariant community size spectra and discuss the implications of our results on allometric scaling laws involving body mass.},

	abstract = {To be useful in understanding natural communities, the analysis of size spectra should reveal seasonal and interlake variability. We calculated size spectra for the planktonic community of Lake Ciso. Data from 3 yr were used to analyze seasonal patterns of size distribution. The average spectrum showed peaks ofbiomass at 0.5-0.7,4, 15,32,64,85, and 200 pm ofequivalent spherical diameter. These peaks corresponded to the dominant organisms in the lake: heterotrophic bacteria, purple phototrophic bacteria, Crypfomonas phaseolus, small ciliates including Coleps hirtus, large ciliates, rotifers including Anuraeopsisfisa. and copepods. The peak at 4 pm was the largest (3 or more times the biomass of the others). We used these data to test the utility of the size spectral approach to describe seasonal changes in the lake. Both linear and polynomial equations were fitted to the normalized spectra. Although the slope of the linear fit did not show any seasonal trend, the second-order coefficient of the polynomial fit presented a clear pattern that made it a useful index of the degree of procaryotic dominance. The lake alternated between anaerobic conditions during mixing, when procaryotes dominated and polynomial fits were best, and stratilication, when polynomial and linear curves fit equally well.},

They revealed an approximately constant size distribution of biomass from bacteria (10 I4 g C cell-‘) to crustaceans ( 1O-4g C ind.-‘), resembling distributions found in open marine systems (seasonal average). Size ranges without detectable biomass as reported from other lakes did not exist. External perturbations, and size and depth of the pelagic zone, but not the type of habitat (marine vs. limnetic) were suggestedas crucial factors influencing the shape of the biomass size distribution. The fit of the normalized biomass size spectrum to a straight line with a slope of - 1.OOwas very close (rZ = 0.98), indicating a decrease of abundance per size class N proportional to the increase of body weight w (N cc w-l). Seasonal variation of biomass per size class was strongly related to body weight. It was largest for organisms with generation times of about 1 yr. Slopes of normalized biomass size spectra were steep in early spring (- 1.16) indicating a dominance of small organisms and a low transfer cfficicncy to larger organisms. From spring to early summer, the size distribution of organisms shifted toward larger organisms (slope up to -0.94). The seasonal changes of the size spectra support the idea that, due to differences in the intrinsic reaction times of differently sized organisms, varying environmental conditions produce less regularly shaped actual size spectra, if not averaged over a period longer than the external fluctuations.},

	abstract = {We conducted in situ diver surveys describing the spatial structure of reef fish assemblages at Kingman Reef, an unexploited and remote atoll in the central North Pacific. Structural patterns reflect natural ecological processes that are not influenced by fishing or other anthropogenic factors. The most striking feature of this assemblage is an inverted biomass pyramid dominated by apex predators, primarily sharks and large snappers, across all depth and habitat strata examined. This pattern is most pronounced at greater depths (20 m) on the fore reef. Apex predators dominated to lesser extents in back-reef, patch-reef, and shallow fore-reef habitats. Prey assemblage size spectra showed fewer large prey and greater numbers of prey from small size classes at locations with greater piscivore biomass. Other patterns of prey abundance generally conformed to those previously observed at more commonly encountered, human-altered reefs (e.g. highest herbivore abundance on back reefs and shallower depths on the fore reefs; greater planktivore prevalence deeper on the fore reef). The latter patterns, however, inadvertently miss the less obvious differences in assemblage dynamics that result from alterations in the size structures of prey fish populations where apex predators have been heavily exploited or extirpated. The present study of a fully intact coral reef suggests that (1) piscivores are common across all habitats and depths, (2) the presence of predators does not lead to appreciable reductions in the biomass of other guilds, and (3) predators alter the size structure and therefore the potential productivity and energy flow of the ecosystem.},

Our current understanding of the consequences of widespread reef degradation currently fails to consider the responses of small mobile invertebrates (‘epifauna’) to patterns of change amongst reef structural elements (‘microhabitats’). Here, the taxonomic composition of 152 epifaunal assemblages was compared among 21 structurally diverse benthic microhabitats across an Australian temperate to tropical climatic gradient, spanning 28.6 degrees in latitude from Tasmania to the northern Great Barrier Reef. Epifauna varied consistently with different microhabitat types, and to a much lesser extent with latitude. Macroalgae, live branching coral and turfing algae represented 3 extremes for epifaunal community structure, with most microhabitats possessing epifaunal assemblages intermediate between these endpoints. Amongst structural characteristics, epifauna related primarily to the degree of branching and hardness of microhabitats. Mobile invertebrate communities are likely to transform in predictable ways with the collapse of large erect macroalgae and live coral towards low-lying turf-associated communities.},

PCR is still the most cost-effective and routinely used method to extract information from environmental samples coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Nichols et al. (2018) metabarcoded nine soil environmental samples from Alaska and six mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides, using a short fragment of the chloroplast trnL gene. The authors tested the effect of PCR replicates, different polymerase mixes and amplicon GC content on diversity estimates. Results show that occurrence data was not biased for any of the parameters tested and only insufficient PCR replicates could impair the detection of rare taxa. For abundance data, polymerases were found to differentially bias estimates of the relative amplicon abundances and this depended on GC content.},

	abstract = {Global species richness, whether estimated by taxon, habitat, or ecosystem, is a key biodiversity metric. Yet, despite the global importance of biodiversity and increasing threats to it (e.g., [1–4]), we are no better able to estimate global species richness now than we were six decades ago [5]. Estimates of global species richness remain highly uncertain and are often logically inconsistent [5]. They are also difﬁcult to validate because estimation of global species richness requires extrapolation beyond the number of species known [6–13]. Given that somewhere between 3\% and {\textgreater}96\% of species on Earth may remain undiscovered [4], depending on the methods used and the taxa considered, such extrapolations, especially from small percentages of known species, are likely to be highly uncertain [13, 14]. An alternative approach is to estimate all species, the known and unknown, directly. Using expert taxonomic knowledge of the species already described and named, those already discovered but not yet described and named, and those still awaiting discovery, we estimate there to be 830,000 (95\% credible limits: 550,000–1,330,000) multi-cellular species on coral reefs worldwide, excluding fungi. Uncertainty surrounding this estimate and its components were often strongly skewed toward larger values, indicating that many more species on coral reefs is more plausible than many fewer. The uncertainties revealed here should guide future research toward achieving convergence in global species richness estimates for coral reefs and other ecosystems via adaptive learning protocols whereby such estimates can be tested and improved, and their uncertainties reduced, as new knowledge is acquired.},

Fossils and phylogenetic studies of plants and animals demonstrate that tropical regions are the source for almost all groups of organisms, and these groups are composed of a mixture of ancient and recently derived lineages. These ﬁndings are consistent with the hypothesis that the large extent of tropical environments during the past 10–50 million years, together with greater climatic stability, has promoted speciation and reduced extinction rates. Energy availability appears to only indirectly contribute to global patterns of species diversity, especially considering how some marine diversity gradients can be completely decoupled from temperature and productivity gradients. Instead, climate stability and time–integrated area together determine the baselines of both terrestrial and marine global diversity patterns. Biotic interactions likely augment diversiﬁcation and coexistence in the tropics.},

	abstract = {In flowing waters, aquatic fauna is typically concentrated in the benthos, wood or other fixed substrates. Aquatic plants and filamentous algae may also offer refugia for invertebrates within the water column, due to flow attenuation, relatively stable substrate and provision of food. We quantified invertebrate abundance, size distribution and species composition along linear, flow-oriented gradients of mixed Cladophora sp. and Elodea canadensis mats in Crow Creek, northern Montana (USA). Mats were divided into four sections (0 – 20, 20 – 40, 40 – 60 and 60 – 80 cm, ordered basal to distal) using a customized sampler. Mat biomass, invertebrate richness and abundance were significantly higher in the 20 – 40 cm section, driven primarily by Cladophora biomass. Meanwhile, Elodea biomass was correlated with invertebrate richness in the 60 – 80 cm section. Most taxa, however, were not individually related to Cladophora or Elodea biomass, except for a positive relationship between Elodea biomass and the amphipod Hyalella azteca in the 0 – 20 cm section, and with cladocerans and copepods (meiofauna) in the 60 – 80 cm section. Biomass size spectra showed no difference among mat segments, but were prominently skewed towards smaller size classes (meiofauna), demonstrating that mats allow the presence of the meiofauna well into the water column of flowing waters. Stream epiphytic invertebrate communities may exhibit complex patterns in abundance and composition, potentially following a neutral model of colonization, movement, and loss of individuals along a linear flow-oriented substrate, but with strong interacting effects of substrate biomass, possible interspecific interactions, or distinct microhabitat preferences.},

Ningaloo Niño typically develops in austral spring, peaks in summer, and decays in autumn, and it often occurs in conjunction with La Niña conditions in the Paciﬁc which promote poleward transport of warm tropical waters by the Leeuwin Current. Since the late 1990s, there has been a marked increase in the occurrence of Ningaloo Niño, which is likely related to the recent swing to the negative phase of the Interdecadal Paciﬁc Oscillation (IPO) and enhanced El Niño–Southern Oscillation variance since 1970s. The swing to the negative IPO sustains positive heat content anomalies and initiates more frequent cyclonic wind anomalies off the WA coast so favoring enhanced poleward heat transport by the Leeuwin Current. The anthropogenically forced global warming has made it easier for natural variability to drive extreme ocean temperatures in the region.},

	abstract = {Zooplankton are the intermediate trophic level between phytoplankton and ﬁsh, and are an important component of carbon and nutrient cycles, accounting for a large proportion of the energy transfer to pelagic ﬁshes and the deep ocean. Given zooplankton’s importance, models need to adequately represent zooplankton dynamics. A major obstacle, though, is the lack of model assessment. Here we try and stimulate the assessment of zooplankton in models by ﬁlling three gaps. The ﬁrst is that many zooplankton observationalists are unfamiliar with the biogeochemical, ecosystem, size-based and individual-based models that have zooplankton functional groups, so we describe their primary uses and how each typically represents zooplankton. The second gap is that many modelers are unaware of the zooplankton data that are available, and are unaccustomed to the different zooplankton sampling systems, so we describe the main sampling platforms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses for model assessment. Filling these gaps in our understanding of models and observations provides the necessary context to address the last gap—a blueprint for model assessment of zooplankton. We detail two ways that zooplankton biomass/abundance observations can be used to assess models: data wrangling that transforms observations to be more similar to model output; and observation models that transform model outputs to be more like observations. We hope that this review will encourage greater assessment of zooplankton in models and ultimately improve the representation of their dynamics.},

	abstract = {Size spectra are recommended tools for detecting the response of marine communities to fishing or to management measures. A size spectrum succinctly describes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size in a community. Required data are often collected in binned form, such as numbers of individuals in 1 cm length bins. Numerous methods have been employed to fit size spectra, but most give biased estimates when tested on simulated data, and none account for the data’s bin structure (breakpoints of bins). Here, we used 8 methods to fit an annual size-spectrum exponent, b, to an example data set (30 yr of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey). The methods gave conflicting conclusions regarding b declining (the size spectrum steepening) through time, and so any resulting advice to ecosystem managers will be highly dependent upon the method used. Using simulated data, we showed that ignoring the bin structure gives biased estimates of b, even for high-resolution data. However, our extended likelihood method, which explicitly accounts for the bin structure, accurately estimated b and its confidence intervals, even for coarsely collected data. We developed a novel visualisation method that accounts for the bin structure and associated uncertainty, provide recommendations concerning different data types and have created an R package (sizeSpectra) to reproduce all results and encourage use of our methods. This work is also relevant to wider applications where a power-law distribution (the underlying distribution for a size spectrum) is fitted to binned data.},

          , 
            Among the most enduring ecological challenges is an integrated theory explaining the latitudinal biodiversity gradient, including discrepancies observed at different spatial scales. Analysis of Reef Life Survey data for 4127 marine species at 2406 coral and rocky sites worldwide confirms that the total ecoregion richness peaks in low latitudes, near +15°N and −15°S. However, although richness at survey sites is maximal near the equator for vertebrates, it peaks at high latitudes for large mobile invertebrates. Site richness for different groups is dependent on abundance, which is in turn correlated with temperature for fishes and nutrients for macroinvertebrates. We suggest that temperature-mediated fish predation and herbivory have constrained mobile macroinvertebrate diversity at the site scale across the tropics. Conversely, at the ecoregion scale, richness responds positively to coral reef area, highlighting potentially huge global biodiversity losses with coral decline. Improved conservation outcomes require management frameworks, informed by hierarchical monitoring, that cover differing site- and regional-scale processes across diverse taxa, including attention to invertebrate species, which appear disproportionately threatened by warming seas.},

Variation between individual divers within volunteer and professional groups also contributed little to total estimated variance between transects compared to residual variation between replicate transects, variation between sites, and variation between regions studied. Sites in 11 MPAs distributed around 5000 km of the Australian coastline had significantly more large ({\textgreater} 30 cm) fishes and total fish biomass than nearby fished reference sites. For the older MPAs, fishes belonging to the largest size class (≥80 cm) were observed approximately 10 times more often in sanctuary zones than in fished zones, while fishes in the smallest size class (2.5 cm) occurred at densities approximately 4 times higher in fished zones than in sanctuary zones. Results of our empirical field surveys contrast in several respects with outcomes of published meta-analyses. No overall differences in fish densities were evident between sanctuary zones and fished zones. The response of fish species richness to protection varied significantly between different MPAs, while invertebrate density and species richness were both significantly lower in sanctuary zones than in fished zones.},

Four different microcosm treatments were set up: two treatments containing defaunated plants inoculated with caprellid amphipods, and two control treatments with natural faunas. The estimated secondary production of faunas enclosed in all microcosm treatments rapidly settled on a constant value (5 rag/day) which was similar to that determined in experiments conducted in Western Australia using the same microcosms but for faunas associated with a seagrass rather than a macroalga. These results support the hypothesis that the secondary production of epifaunal communities associated with macrophytes is constrained by quantifiable food resource ceilings.},

	abstract = {When data from a number of macroalgal, seagrass and unvegetated sites were anaiysed, log abundance of macrofauna in different sieve size-classes was found to show a consistently linear negative relationship with log sieve size. The log abundance/log sieve-size regression coefficient, referred to as the size-dominance index G, has consequently been used as a simple index of the size-structure of macrofaunal communities. Size-dominance varied consistently between infaunal and epifaunal communities, and between communities inhabiting different macroalgal habitats. Size-dominance was lowest in detached macrophyte (G= -4.2) and filamentous algal (z = -3.4) habitats, and highest in infaunal habitats (G = -1.5). This spatial variation in sizedominance, and also observed temporal variation, was attributed partly to variation in the level of food resources and to variation in epibenthic (i.e. fish and decapod) predation. Alternative hypotheses proposed by Thiel(1975) and Warwick et al. (1987) dealing with the size-distributions of benthic communities did not fully predict observed patterns. Predictions are made here that whenever G{\textless} -2.1, then either epibenthic predation is extremely high within the habitat or a surplus of food resources has recently been made available to the fauna; whenever G b -2.1, then animals are exploitatively competing for limited food resources with epibenthic predation being of little importance. Production remains constant in different log size-classes when G = -2.1, hence the plot of estimated production versus log body-size is considered a useful way to depict fauna1 size-distributions.},

	abstract = {Background: The rising temperature of the world’s oceans has become a major threat to coral reefs globally as the severity and frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality events increase. In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers’ field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80\% of corals bleached and over 40\% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles.
Conclusions/Significance: Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch’s Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity. This severe, widespread bleaching and mortality will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for reef ecosystems and suggests a troubled future for tropical marine ecosystems under a warming climate.},

We consider the direct and indirect effects of subsistence exploitation upon the size structure of coral reef fish communities along an island-scale spatial gradient of fishing intensity. We explored the effect of fishing intensity and sample date (three dates over a year) at six islands and the overall effect of fishing intensity averaged over sample dates at 13 islands. Fishing intensity consistently explained more of the variation in the size metrics than sample date. In response to exploitation, the mean weight of individuals declined by 52\%, the weighted average maximum size (Lmax) declined by 25\%, and slopes of community size spectra steepened. The larger size classes ({\textgreater}26 cm) declined in relative numbers by 63\% and relative biomass by 61\% in response to exploitation. However, the numbers and biomass of the three smallest size classes ({\textless}25 cm) increased by 31\% and 9\%, respectively, in response to exploitation. This increased abundance is consistent with a weak compensatory response presumably from a reduction in predation upon smaller size classes as an indirect effect of exploiting larger size classes.},

            Marine fisheries provide a major global source of protein, feeding billions of people, but they face destabilization in many regions from overexploitation and climate change. Using the most comprehensive dataset of fish diversity and abundance, encompassing over 4,500 surveys from nearshore habitats around the world, we show that biodiversity is among the strongest predictors of reef fish community biomass, comparable in importance to global temperature gradients and human impacts. Importantly, diverse fish communities were more resistant to rising and variable temperature, suggesting that high biodiversity also buffers against changing climate. Maintaining taxonomically and functionally diverse fish communities can thus stabilize fisheries’ yields in a changing ocean.

            Fishes are the most diverse group of vertebrates, play key functional roles in aquatic ecosystems, and provide protein for a billion people, especially in the developing world. Those functions are compromised by mounting pressures on marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Because of its economic and food value, fish biomass production provides an unusually direct link from biodiversity to critical ecosystem services. We used the Reef Life Survey’s global database of 4,556 standardized fish surveys to test the importance of biodiversity to fish production relative to 25 environmental drivers. Temperature, biodiversity, and human influence together explained 47\% of the global variation in reef fish biomass among sites. Fish species richness and functional diversity were among the strongest predictors of fish biomass, particularly for the large-bodied species and carnivores preferred by fishers, and these biodiversity effects were robust to potentially confounding influences of sample abundance, scale, and environmental correlations. Warmer temperatures increased biomass directly, presumably by raising metabolism, and indirectly by increasing diversity, whereas temperature variability reduced biomass. Importantly, diversity and climate interact, with biomass of diverse communities less affected by rising and variable temperatures than species-poor communities. Biodiversity thus buffers global fish biomass from climate change, and conservation of marine biodiversity can stabilize fish production in a changing ocean.},

Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material ﬂows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend.},

This proposition was examined for intertidal macrofauna from a well-studied estuarine system, using kernel density estimation to deﬁne modality and the locations of peaks and troughs. Three sedimentary environments and habitats were examined along a disturbance gradient related to eutrophication. Our results indicate that bimodality is likely to occur within the macrofauna size range, which weakens the habitat architecture model and casts doubts on the mechanisms behind other modes in benthic size spectra. The location of the modes and intervening trough were not conservative and not apparently related to sediment grain size or habitat structure, but somewhat dependent on the presence of particular species: the presence or absence of large numbers of individuals of Hydrobia ulvae and larger-bodied taxa such as Scrobicularia plana and Hediste diversicolor. Alternative competing hypotheses are explored for the observed results, including Warwick's (1984) phylogenetic explanation, but taking into consideration both species composition and disturbance impact, it seems most likely Holling's (1992) textural discontinuity hypothesis, as a measure of resilience, could be a plausible explanation.},

Here, we interpret these ratios in terms of the elementary processes of food intake, specific production rate, and gross growth efficiency that underlie them. Recent information confirms that the magnitude of all these processes is related to the average body mass of the organisms involved. However, our analysis shows that this well-known dependence reflects the influence of two different basic biological properties. One of these is the metabolism-body-size relation of individuals that is familiar from physiology. The other less well-recognized property appears as an ecological population factor reflected in the distribution of particle sizes within animal groups in the community and is probably related to the relative sizes and distributions of predators and their prey. It appears that both the physiological and ecological size relationships have to be recognized as scaling factors in order to transform measures of biological production of various parts of communities into common terms for comparison. Current data on the generality and stability of community structure and production suggest that by using this twofold size scaling, trophic energy flow within the community can be determined from the distribution of body sizes without the necessity of specifying trophic levels of the organisms involved. The ecological size scaling can be seen as an index of the system nature of ecosystems.},

Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters. Dead zones have now been reported from more than 400 systems, affecting a total area of more than 245,000 square kilometers, and are probably a key stressor on marine ecosystems.},

Using a systematic expansion of the master equation, we derive a deterministic equation for the macroscopic dynamics, which we call the deterministic jump-growth equation, and a linear Fokker–Planck equation for the stochastic ﬂuctuations. The McKendrick–von Foerster equation, used in previous studies, is shown to be a ﬁrst-order approximation, appropriate in equilibrium systems where predators are much larger than their prey. The model has a power-law steady state consistent with the approximate constancy of mass density in logarithmic intervals of body mass often observed in marine ecosystems. The behaviours of the stochastic process, the deterministic jump-growth equation, and the McKendrick–von Foerster equation are compared using numerical methods. The numerical analysis shows two classes of attractors: steady states and travelling waves.},

            We investigate changes in the North Sea fish community with particular reference to possible indirect effects of fishing, mediated through the ecosystem. In the past, long-term changes in the slope of size spectra of research vessel catches have been related to changes in fishing effort, but such changes may simply reflect the cumulative, direct effects of fishing through selective removal of large individuals. If there is resilience in a fish community towards fishing, we may expect increases in specific components, for instance as a consequence of an associated reduction in predation and/or competition. We show on the basis of three long-term trawl surveys that abundance of small fish (all species) as well as abundance of demersal species with a low maximum length (Lmax) have steadily and significantly increased in absolute numbers over large parts of the North Sea during the last 30 years. Taking average fishing mortality of assessed commercial species as an index of exploitation rate of the fish community, it appears that fishing effort reached its maximum in the mid-1980s and has declined slightly since. If the observed changes in the community are caused by indirect effects of fishing, there must be a considerable delay in response time, because the observed changes generally proceed up to recent years, although both size and Lmax spectra suggest some levelling off, or even recovery in one of the surveys. Indeed, significant correlations between all community metrics and exploitation rate were obtained only if time lags ≥6 years were introduced.},

              Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse systems in the ocean, and they provide both food and ecological services. They are also highly threatened by climate change and human pressure. Cinner
              et al.
              looked at how best to maximize three key components of reef use and health: fish biomass, parrotfish grazing, and fish trait diversity. They found that when human pressure is low, all three traits can be maximized at high conservation levels. However, as human use and pressure increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to promote biodiversity conservation. At some levels of human impact, even the highest amount of protection is not able to maximize biodiversity conservation.

          , 
            The worldwide decline of coral reefs necessitates targeting management solutions that can sustain reefs and the livelihoods of the people who depend on them. However, little is known about the context in which different reef management tools can help to achieve multiple social and ecological goals. Because of nonlinearities in the likelihood of achieving combined fisheries, ecological function, and biodiversity goals along a gradient of human pressure, relatively small changes in the context in which management is implemented could have substantial impacts on whether these goals are likely to be met. Critically, management can provide substantial conservation benefits to most reefs for fisheries and ecological function, but not biodiversity goals, given their degraded state and the levels of human pressure they face.},

We conducted a systematic review of published data on the biomass of coral reef fishes to explore how the condition of reef fisheries is related to the density of local human populations, proximity of the reef to markets, and key environmental variables (including broad geomorphologic reef type, reef area, and net productivity). When only population density and environmental covariates were considered, high variability in fisheries conditions at low human population densities resulted in relatively weak explanatory models. The presence or absence of human settlements, habitat type, and distance to fish markets provided a much stronger explanatory model for the condition of reef fisheries. Fish biomass remained relatively low within 14 km of markets, then biomass increased exponentially as distance from reefs to markets increased. Our results suggest the need for an increased science and policy focus on markets as both a key driver of the condition of reef fisheries and a potential source of solutions.},

Here, we show that when sampling is standardised by area (species density) or individuals (rareﬁed species richness), the measured effect sizes depend critically on the spatial grain and extent of sampling, as well as the size of the species pool. This compromises comparisons of effects sizes within studies using standard statistics, as well as among studies using meta-analysis. To derive an unambiguous effect size, we advocate that comparisons need to be made on a scale-independent metric, such as Hurlbert’s Probability of Interspeciﬁc Encounter. Analyses of this metric can be used to disentangle the relative inﬂuence of changes in the absolute and relative abundances of individuals, as well as their intraspeciﬁc aggregations, in driving differences in biodiversity among communities. This and related approaches are necessary to achieve generality in understanding how biodiversity responds to ecological drivers and will necessitate a change in the way many ecologists collect and analyse their data.},

This assumption predicts a power-law distribution of the ISD, i.e., a linear relationship between size and abundance in log space. However, the secondary structure of ISD (nonlinear dome shape structures deviating from a power-law distribution) is often observed. We propose a model that extends the metabolic theory to link the secondary structure of ISD to the nonlinear size–TL relationship. This model is tested with empirical data collected from a subtropical reservoir. The empirical ISD and size–TL relationships were constructed by FlowCAM imaging analysis and stable isotope analyses, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the secondary structure of ISD can be predicted from the nonlinear function of size–TL relationship and vice versa. Moreover, these secondary structures arise due to (1) zooplankton omnivory and (2) the trophic interactions within microbial food webs.},

            Community metrics describe aspects of community structure and are often calculated from species-size-abundance data collected during fish stock monitoring surveys. Several community metrics have been proposed as indicators to support ecosystem-based fishery management. These metrics should be sensitive to fishing impacts and respond rapidly to management action, so that managers can assess whether changes in the fish community are a desirable or undesirable response to management. It should also be possible to estimate metrics with sufficient precision so that changes in the community can be detected on management time scales of a year to a few years. Here, we test the power of a large-scale annual trawl survey (North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey, IBTS) to detect trends in six community metrics: mean length, mean weight, mean maximum length, mean maximum weight, slope of the biomass size spectrum, and mean trophic level. Our analyses show that the power of the trawl survey to detect trends is generally poor. While community metrics do provide good long-term indicators of changes in fish community structure, they are unlikely to provide an appropriate tool to support short-term management decisions. If fish community metrics are to provide effective support for ecosystem-based management, and management time scales cannot be extended, then the power of many surveys to detect trends in fish community structure will need to be improved by increased replication and standardization.},

The discontinuity hypothesis provides a fertile avenue for addressing this problem by linking measureable proxies to inherent scales of structure within ecosystems. Here we outline the conceptual framework underlying discontinuities and review the evidence supporting the discontinuity hypothesis in ecological systems. Next we explore the utility of this approach for understanding cross-scale patterns and the organization of ecosystems by describing recent advances for examining nonlinear responses to disturbance and phenomena such as extinctions, invasions, and resilience. To stimulate new research, we present methods for performing discontinuity analysis, detail outstanding knowledge gaps, and discuss potential approaches for addressing these gaps.},

However, while there are many studies on the context and politics of gender and fisheries, understanding how power influences gender equality remains understudied, especially in the Western Indian Ocean. Based on evidence gathered from an interdisciplinary set of literature, including sectoral policies, this article provides nuanced insight at rethinking - how gendered-power dynamics constrain and enable choices and opportunities for addressing gender inequality in small-scale fisheries. Compelling evi­ dence shows that a gendered-power dynamic is crucial for renegotiating gender equality with social norms and politics, including challenging simplistic views on poverty, vulnerability, and subordination of women.

The grazing capacity of these fishes could be impaired if marine reserves achieve their long-term goal of restoring large consumers, several of which prey on parrotfishes. Here we compare the negative impacts of enhanced predation with the positive impacts of reduced fishing mortality on parrotfishes inside reserves. Because large-bodied parrotfishes escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the Nassau grouper), the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8\%. This impact was overwhelmed by the increase in density of large parrotfishes, resulting in a net doubling of grazing. Increased grazing caused a fourfold reduction in the cover of macroalgae, which, because they are the principal competitors of corals, highlights the potential importance of reserves for coral reef resilience.},

There is a growing volume of literature describing satellite algorithms to retrieve information on phytoplankton composition in the ocean. This synthesis provides a review of current methods and a simpliﬁed comparison of approaches. The aim is to provide an easily comprehensible resource for non-algorithm developers, who desire to use these products, thereby raising the level of awareness and use of these products and reducing the boundary of expert knowledge needed to make a pragmatic selection of output products with conﬁdence. The satellite input and output products, their associated validation metrics, as well as assumptions, strengths, and limitations of the various algorithm types are described, providing a framework for algorithm organization to assist users and inspire new aspects of algorithm development capable of exploiting the higher spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions from the next generation of ocean color satellites.},

	abstract = {Coral reef fisheries support the livelihoods of millions of people in tropical countries, despite large-scale depletion of fish biomass. While human adaptability can help to explain the resistance of fisheries to biomass depletion, compensatory ecological mechanisms may also be involved. If this is the case, high productivity should coexist with low biomass under relatively high exploitation. Here we integrate large spatial scale empirical data analysis and a theory-driven modelling approach to unveil the effects of human exploitation on reef fish productivity–biomass relationships. We show that differences in how productivity and biomass respond to overexploitation can decouple their relationship. As size-selective exploitation depletes fish biomass, it triggers increased production per unit biomass, averting immediate productivity collapse in both the modelling and the empirical systems. This ‘buffering productivity’ exposes the danger of assuming resource production–biomass equivalence, but may help to explain why some biomassdepleted fish assemblages still provide ecosystem goods under continued global fishing exploitation.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs harbor high productivity in nutrient-poor tropical oceans. This exceptional productivity can be explained by high recycling rates [1, 2], deepwater nutrient enrichment [3], and assimilation of external production [4]. Fishes consume this productivity through multiple trophic pathways and, as a result, dominate consumer biomass. Their reliance on pelagic versus benthic productivity pathways has been quantiﬁed from the tissues of individual ﬁsh [5, 6], but the contribution of different energetic pathways to the total productivity of coral reef ﬁsh assemblages remains unquantiﬁed. Here, we combined high-resolution surveys and individual biomass production estimates to generate the ﬁrst energetic map of a full coral reef ﬁsh assemblage, from the smallest to the largest ﬁshes [7, 8]. We found that the windward section of a coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef delivered an average ﬁsh productivity of 4.7 kg haÀ1 dayÀ1, of which 41\% was derived from water column photosynthesis, 29\% by the epibenthic reef surface, 14\% from cryptobenthic microhabitats, and 11\% from adjacent sandy areas. The critical energetic contribution of pelagic subsidies would remain undetected if considering ﬁsh standing biomass alone, because the high productivity of reef planktivores originated from a relatively small biomass. Importantly, this study took place on a reef with only \$6\% of coral cover following multiple coral mortality events. Thus, our study offers hope that reefs subject to coral loss can still maintain considerable ﬁsh productivity, with planktivorous ﬁshes providing major pelagic subsidies.},

Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversiﬁcation. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversiﬁcation rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversiﬁcation in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of ﬁsh age and growth is crucial for species conservation and management of exploited marine stocks. In exploited species, age estimation based on otolith reading is routinely used for building growth curves that are used to implement ﬁshery management models. However, the universal ﬁt of the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) on data from commercial landings can lead to uncertainty in growth parameter inference, preventing accurate comparison of growth-based history traits between ﬁsh populations. In the present paper, we used a comprehensive annual sample of wild gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) in the Gulf of Lions (France, NW Mediterranean) to test a methodology improving growth modelling for exploited ﬁsh populations. After validating the timing for otolith annual increment formation for all life stages, a comprehensive set of growth models (including VBGF) were ﬁtted to the obtained ageelength data, used as a whole or sub-divided between group 0 individuals and those coming from commercial landings (ages 1e6). Comparisons in growth model accuracy based on Akaike Information Criterion allowed assessment of the best model for each dataset and, when no model correctly ﬁtted the data, a multi-model inference (MMI) based on model averaging was carried out. The results provided evidence that growth parameters inferred with VBGF must be used with high caution. Hence, VBGF turned to be among the less accurate for growth prediction irrespective of the dataset and its ﬁt to the whole population, the juvenile or the adult datasets provided different growth parameters. The best models for growth prediction were the Tanaka model, for group 0 juveniles, and the MMI, for the older ﬁsh, conﬁrming that growth differs substantially between juveniles and adults. All asymptotic models failed to correctly describe the growth of adult S. aurata, probably because of the poor representation of old individuals in the dataset. Multi-model inference associated with separate analysis of juveniles and adult ﬁsh is then advised to obtain objective estimations of growth parameters when sampling cannot be corrected towards older ﬁsh.},

	abstract = {The density of organisms declines with size, because larger organisms need more energy than smaller ones and energetic losses occur when larger organisms feed on smaller ones. A potential expression of density-size distributions are Normalized Biomass Size Spectra (NBSS), which plot the logarithm of biomass independent of taxonomy within bins of logarithmic organismal size, divided by the bin width. Theoretically, the NBSS slope of multi-trophic communities is exactly À1.0 if the trophic transfer efficiency (TTE, ratio of production rates between adjacent trophic levels) is 10\% and the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) is fixed at 104. Here we provide evidence from four multi-trophic lake food webs that empirically estimated TTEs correspond to empirically estimated slopes of the respective community NBSS. Each of the NBSS considered pelagic and benthic organisms spanning size ranges from bacteria to fish, all sampled over three seasons in 1 yr. The four NBSS slopes were significantly steeper than À1.0 (range À1.14 to À1.19, with 95\% CIs excluding À1). The corresponding average TTEs were substantially lower than 10\% in each of the four food webs (range 1.0\% to 3.6\%, mean 1.85\%). The overall slope merging all biomass-size data pairs from the four systems (À1.17) was almost identical to the slope predicted from the arithmetic mean TTE of the four food webs (À1.18) assuming a constant PPMR of 104. Accordingly, our empirical data confirm the theoretically predicted quantitative relationship between TTE and the slope of the biomass-size distribution. Furthermore, we show that benthic and pelagic organisms can be merged into a community NBSS, but future studies have yet to explore potential differences in habitat-specific TTEs and PPMRs. We suggest that community NBSS may provide valuable information on the structure of food webs and their energetic pathways, and can result in improved accuracy of TTE-estimates.},

            Biogeography has focused extensively on species identities, yet global patterns in species traits (morphological, physiological, or behavioral features) are not well known, including whether they are shaped by modern environmental conditions or by shared evolutionary history. Our global analysis of nearly 3,000 reef fish species found a consistent variety of traits across ocean basins worldwide, including a backbone of 21 trait combinations common to all oceans. At the regional scale, we found that fish assemblages in similar environments had similar trait compositions despite being separated by up to 100 degrees of latitude and hosting different species with distinct evolutionary histories. Thus, environmental conditions have likely shaped global patterns in reef fish traits regardless of geography, species identity, or evolutionary history.
          , 
            Species’ traits, rather than taxonomic identities, determine community assembly and ecosystem functioning, yet biogeographic patterns have been far less studied for traits. While both environmental conditions and evolutionary history shape trait biogeography, their relative contributions are largely unknown for most organisms. Here, we explore the global biogeography of reef fish traits for 2,786 species from 89 ecoregions spanning eight marine realms with contrasting environmental conditions and evolutionary histories. Across realms, we found a common structure in the distribution of species traits despite a 10-fold gradient in species richness, with a defined “backbone” of 21 trait combinations shared by all realms globally, both temperate and tropical. Across ecoregions, assemblages under similar environmental conditions had similar trait compositions despite hosting drastically different species pools from separate evolutionary lineages. Thus, despite being separated by thousands of kilometers and millions of years of evolution, similar environments host similar trait compositions in reef fish assemblages worldwide. Our findings suggest that similar trait-based management strategies can be applied among regions with distinct species pools, potentially improving conservation outcomes across diverse jurisdictions.},

These eight ecological metrics each exhibited specific thresholds along a continuum of fishable biomass ranging from heavily fished sites to old fisheries closures.

Both the height of the size structure graph (which is a value of overall abundance–biomass) and the assemblage biomass graph are convex polynomials with a maximum biomass of 1200 kg ha–1 at 22 yr. This suggests that full recovery of coral reef fish assemblages in terms of abundance–biomass is considerably longer than generally believed. Beyond 25 yr, there can be a small loss in biomass, which we suggest is due to reduced net primary production associated with the increased abundance of calcifying algae attributable to intense grazing. Size spectra slopes were variable at all times, changed quickly, and were probably influenced by local environmental conditions, which made concise predictions for equilibrium coral reef size structure rather difficult.},

Biovolume was measured for every individual separately (i.e. allowing the same species to occupy multiple size classes) and divided into log2 body size bins. Analyses were conducted for all gastropods together and separated into orders and depth regions (representing different nutrient inputs). A kernel smoothing technique, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of ﬁt, and OLS and RMA were used to characterize the patterns.
Results Overall, the relationship between the number of individuals and species is right skewed. There is also a positive linear relationship between the number of individuals and the number of species, which is independent of body size. Variation among these relationships is seen among the three depth regions. At depths inferred to correspond with intermediate nutrient input levels, species are accumulated faster given the number of individuals and shift from a right-skewed to a log-normal distribution.
Conclusion A strong link between body size, abundance, and species richness appears to be ubiquitous over a variety of taxa and environments, including the deep sea. However, the nature of these relationships is affected by the productivity regime and scale at which they are examined.},

Here, employing simple and general empirical arguments concerning the nature of movement, trophic position and behaviour we outline a general theory concerning the role of space and food web structure on food web stability. We argue that consumers link food webs in space and that this spatial structure combined with relatively rapid behavioural responses by consumers can strongly inﬂuence the dynamics of food webs. Employing simple spatially implicit food web models, we show that large mobile consumers are inordinately important in determining the stability, or lack of it, in ecosystems. More speciﬁcally, this theory suggests that mobile higher order organisms are potent stabilizers when embedded in a variable, and expansive spatial structure. However, when space is compressed and higher order consumers strongly couple local habitats then mobile consumers can have an inordinate destabilizing effect. Preliminary empirical arguments show consistency with this general theory.},

              Global warming is expected to cause reductions in organism body size, a fundamental biological unit important in determining biological processes. Possible effects of increasing temperature on biomass size spectra in coastal benthic communities were investigated. We hypothesized higher proportions of smaller size classes in warmer conditions. Soft bottom infauna samples were collected in six Norwegian and Svalbard fjords, spanning wide latitudinal (60–81°N) and bottom water temperature gradients (from −2 to 8 °C). Investigated fjords differed in terms of environmental settings (e.g., pigments or organic carbon in sediments). The slopes of normalised biomass size spectra (NBSS) did not differ among the fjords, while the benthic biomass and NBSS intercepts varied and were related to chlorophyll

              C in sediments. The size spectra based on both abundance and biomass remained consistent, regardless of the strong variability in macrofauna taxonomic and functional trait composition. Variable relationships between temperature and body size were noted for particular taxa. Our results indicate that while benthic biomass depends on the nutritional quality of organic matter, its partitioning among size classes is consistent and independent of environmental and biological variability. The observed size structure remains a persistent feature of studied communities and may be resilient to major climatic changes.},

Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines.

It uses time-series data to calculate average rates of change in a large number of populations of terrestrial, freshwater and marine vertebrate species. The dataset contains about 3000 population time series for over 1100 species. Two methods of calculating the index are outlined: the chain method and a method based on linear modelling of log-transformed data. The dataset is analysed to compare the relative representation of biogeographic realms, ecoregional biomes, threat status and taxonomic groups among species contributing to the index.
            The two methods show very similar results: terrestrial species declined on average by 25\% from 1970 to 2000. Birds and mammals are over-represented in comparison with other vertebrate classes, and temperate species are over-represented compared with tropical species, but there is little difference in representation between threatened and non-threatened species. Some of the problems arising from over-representation are reduced by the way in which the index is calculated. It may be possible to reduce this further by post-stratification and weighting, but new information would first need to be collected for data-poor classes, realms and biomes.},

The results showed that abundance of meiofauna was higher in shallow water sediments (average of 2 445 ind./(10 cm2)) than in deep sea sediments (407.06 ind./(10 cm2)).

Such models internalize body growth and mortality from predation, allowing bookkeeping of biomass at a detailed level of individual predation and growth and enabling scaling up to the mass balance of the ecosystem. Exploitation set independently for each species with knife-edge, size-at-entry ﬁshing can lead to collapse of cod. Exploitation to achieve a ﬁxed ratio of yield to productivity across species can also lead to collapse of cod. However, harvesting balanced to the overall productivity of species in the exploited ecosystem exerts a strong force countering such collapse. If balancing across species is applied to a ﬁshery with knife-edge selection, size distributions are truncated, changing the structure of the system and reducing its resilience to perturbations. If balancing is applied on the basis of productivity at each body size as well as across species, there is less disruption to size-structure, resilience is increased, and substantially greater biomass yields are possible. We note an identity between the body size at which productivity is maximized and the age at which cohort biomass is maximized. In our numerical results based on detailed bookkeeping of biomass, cohort biomass reaches its maximum at body masses {\textless}1 g, unlike standard yield-per-recruit models, where body growth and mortality are independent externalities, and cohort biomass is maximized at larger body sizes.},

A recent suggestion is that it could be better to distribute ﬁshing more widely across species and body sizes, balancing it more closely to the natural productivity of different organisms. Here, we test effects of such ﬁshing against more traditional methods using a model of a single ﬁsh species with a dynamic size spectrum together with a ﬁxed spectrum of plankton. This has the feature that productivity is determined by the bookkeeping of biomass in the model, and decreases as ﬁsh grow larger. The results show that harvesting smaller ﬁsh (which have higher productivity) allows a greater sustainable biomass yield than harvesting larger ﬁsh (which have lower productivity); the greater spawning-stock biomass that comes from protecting large ﬁsh contributes to this. Balanced exploitation brings ﬁshing mortality more in line with this natural variation in productivity. In addition, the resilience of the ecosystem to perturbations can be improved, and disruption to the size distribution of organisms in the ecosystem reduced. We argue that there are potentially real beneﬁts to be gained by moving towards more balanced exploitation of marine ecosystems, unconventional though this is.},

Here, a stochastic individual-based model for the dynamics of size spectra is described, based on birth, growth, and death of individuals, using simple assumptions about feeding behavior. It is shown that the deterministic limit derived from the stochastic process is a partial differential equation previously used to describe the dynamics of size spectra. The equation has two classes of dynamics in the long term. The ﬁrst is a steady state. A derivation under simple mass-balance assumptions shows that, at steady state, the linear size spectrum relating log abundance to log mass has a slope of approximately À1, similar to that often observed in natural size spectra. The second class of dynamics, not previously described, is a traveling-wave solution in which waves move along the size spectrum from small to large body size. Traveling waves become more likely when predators prefer prey much smaller than themselves and when they are specialized in the range of prey body sizes consumed. Wavelength depends on the size of prey relative to the size of predator, and wave speed depends on how fast mass moves through the spectrum.},

The subsequent recovery trajectories at sheltered and exposed sites are surprisingly parallel and lead communities towards their respective pre-bleaching communities. These results demonstrate that in the absence of human stressors, community patterns on fore reefs are strongly controlled by wave exposure, even during and after widespread coral loss from bleaching events.},

Species richness has also been shown to follow a humped relationship with body size, suggesting that SAR and STR may also depend on body size. We test whether the pattern of increase in the number of species with time varies with species body size. We analyzed data on carnivorous and scavenger species collected in a shallow marine benthic megafauna community in Coliumo Bay, Chile. Body size data were tabulated into exponential body size classes using two binning strategies. Species-level binning represented all individuals of each species by their average body size. Individual-level binning tabulated all data into exponential body size classes, allowing species to potentially occupy multiple size classes. We determined empirical relationships between body size and species richness, as well as estimated temporal species accumulation curves (TSAC) and nested species–time relationships (NSTR). We also tested whether the increase of species richness within body size classes follows either a power-law relationship or a logarithmic function. We find that the number of species increases with the time span studied, both for a TSAC and in the NSTR, for both species-based and individual-based data, while also showing a unimodal relationship with body size for both species and individual-based data. Thus, the STR is a general pattern, which depends on body size, despite reproductive seasonal forcing and strong hypoxia disturbance in Coliumo Bay.},

	abstract = {We study the temporal variation in the empirical relationships among body size (S), species richness (R), and abundance (A) in a shallow marine epibenthic faunal community in Coliumo Bay, Chile. We also extend previous analyses by calculating individual energy use (E) and test whether its bivariate and trivariate relationships with S and R are in agreement with expectations derived from the energetic equivalence rule. Carnivorous and scavenger species representing over 95\% of sample abundance and biomass were studied. For each individual, body size (g) was measured and E was estimated following published allometric relationships. Data for each sample were tabulated into exponential body size bins, comparing species-averaged values with individual-based estimates which allow species to potentially occupy multiple size classes. For individual-based data, both the number of individuals and species across body size classes are ﬁt by a Weibull function rather than by a power law scaling. Species richness is also a power law of the number of individuals. Energy use shows a piecewise scaling relationship with body size, with energetic equivalence holding true only for size classes above the modal abundance class. Species-based data showed either weak linear or no signiﬁcant patterns, likely due to the decrease in the number of data points across body size classes. Hence, for individual-based size spectra, the SRA relationship seems to be general despite seasonal forcing and strong disturbances in Coliumo Bay. The unimodal abundance distribution results in a piecewise energy scaling relationship, with small individuals showing a positive scaling and large individuals showing energetic equivalence. Hence, strict energetic equivalence should not be expected for unimodal abundance distributions. On the other hand, while species-based data do not show unimodal SRA relationships, energy use across body size classes did not show signiﬁcant trends, supporting energetic equivalence.},

	abstract = {The common practice among researchers who study ﬁsh growth is to a priori adopt the von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM), which is the most used and ubiquitous equation in the ﬁsheries literature. However, in many cases VBGM is not supported by the data and many species seem to follow different growth trajectories. The information theory approach frees the researcher from the limiting concept that a ‘true’ growth model exists. Multi-model inference (MMI) based on information theory is proposed as a more robust alternative to study ﬁsh growth. The proposed methodology was applied to 133 sets of length-at-age data. Four candidate models were ﬁtted to each data set: von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM), Gompertz model, Logistic and the Power model; the three former assume asymptotic and the latter non-asymptotic growth. In each case, the ‘best’ model was selected by minimizing the small-sample, bias-corrected form of the Akaike information criterion (AICc). To quantify the plausibility of each model, the ‘Akaike weight’ wi of each model was calculated. Following a MMI approach, the model averaged asymptotic length L 1 for each case was estimated, by model averaging estimations of L1 interpreting Akaike weights as a posterior probability distribution over the set of candidate models. The VBGM was not selected as the best model in 65.4\% of the cases. Most often VBGM was either strongly supported by the data (with no other substantially supported model) or had very low or no support by the data. The estimation of asymptotic length was greatly model dependent; L1 as estimated by VBGM was in every case greater than that estimated by the Gompertz model, which in turn was always greater than that estimated by the Logistic model. The percentage underestimation of the standard error of L1, when ignoring model selection uncertainty, was on average 18\% with values as high as 91\%. Ignoring model selection uncertainty may have serious implications, e.g. when comparing the growth parameters of different ﬁsh populations. Multi-model inference by model averaging, based on Akaike weights, is recommended as a simple and easy to implement method to model ﬁsh growth, for making robust parameter estimations and dealing with model selection uncertainty.},

We present a simple synthesis of the complex structure and function of a real marine food web, based on analyses of body size distributions, production-body size relationships and trophic level-body size relationships. We show how size-based estimates of production, species richness and trophic level (from nitrogen stable isotope analysis) can be used to quantify trophic transfer efficiency, mean predator-prey body-mass ratios and the mean ratio of the number of predator to prey species in marine food webs. We applied these methods to the central North Sea, and estimated transfer efficiencies of 3.7 to 12.4\%, a mean predator-prey body-mass ratio of 109:1 and a mean ratio of the number of predator to prey species of 0.34. We conducted sensitivity analyses to show how differences in the fractionation of δ15N and changes in the slope of the relationship between production and δ15N affected our predictions. Our estimates of transfer efficiency and mean predator-prey body-mass ratios are similar to those obtained by costly and labour-intensive diet- and ecosystem-modelling studies. Coupled analyses of size and trophic structure may provide a method for validating ecosystem models and assessing human impacts on marine ecosystems.},

This is expected to lead to steeper scalings of N with M. Here, we formalize and test an existing model for predicting abundance–body mass scaling, where the decline in E with M is calculated from the mean predator–prey body mass ratio (from size-based nitrogen stable isotope analysis) and trophic transfer efficiency. We show that the steep predicted scalings of abundance and body mass (N scales as M )1.2, B scales as M )0.2) in a marine food web are consistent with empirical estimates and can be attributed to the small predator–prey body mass ratio (106 : 1). As a previous study has shown that environmental stability may favour low predator–prey mass ratios and long food chains, we predict that steeper abundance–body mass relationships will be found in more stable environments.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Size-based community and ecosystem metrics, such as mean body mass and the slopes of size spectra, have been proposed as indicators to support the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). These metrics show relatively consistent responses to size-selective exploitation, and “unexploited” indicator reference points may be predicted with models of size-structured foodwebs. Whereas unexploited reference points provide a baseline for assessing the relative magnitude of fishing impacts, target or limit reference points are needed to guide management. Values for target or limit reference points are difficult to justify on scientific grounds. However, given that fishing impacts in most ecosystems need to be reduced to meet the objectives of the EAFM, we argue that reference directions provide alternative medium-term management targets. We show that the power of surveys to detect trends consistent with reference directions depends on the range of body size classes included in the analysis. Selection of different size ranges will weight metrics to respond to the release of small fish from predation, the depletion of larger individuals as a consequence of exploitation, or both. Such weightings may not be consistent over time, because the differential vulnerability of larger species, within-population changes, predator–prey relationships, and the effects of competition depend on contemporary rates of fishing mortality and the history of exploitation. The power of the surveys investigated is poor on time scales of less than 5–10 years. Therefore, size-based indicators provide better support for medium-term, rather than year-on-year, management decision making.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis that the optimal search strategy is a Lévy walk (LW) or Lévy flight, originally suggested in 1995, has generated an explosion of interest and controversy. Long-standing empirical evidence supporting the LW hypothesis has been overturned, while new models and data are constantly being published. Statistical methods have been criticized and new methods put forward. In parallel with the empirical studies, theoretical search models have been developed. Some theories have been disproved while others remain. Here, we gather together the current state of the art on the role of LWs in optimal foraging theory. We examine the body of theory underpinning the subject. Then we present new results showing that deviations from the idealized one-dimensional search model greatly reduce or remove the advantage of LWs. The search strategy of an LW with exponent
              μ
              = 2 is therefore not as robust as is widely thought. We also review the available techniques, and their potential pitfalls, for analysing field data. It is becoming increasingly recognized that there is a wide range of mechanisms that can lead to the apparent observation of power-law patterns. The consequence of this is that the detection of such patterns in field data implies neither that the foragers in question are performing an LW, nor that they have evolved to do so. We conclude that LWs are neither a universal optimal search strategy, nor are they as widespread in nature as was once thought.},

	abstract = {Balanced harvesting, where species or individuals are exploited in accordance with their productivity, has been proposed as a way to minimize the effects of fishing on marine fish communities and ecosystems. This calls for a thorough examination of the consequences balanced harvesting has on fish community structure and yield. We use a size- and trait-based model that resolves individual interactions through competition and predation to compare balanced harvesting with traditional selective harvesting, which protects juvenile fish from fishing. Four different exploitation patterns, generated by combining selective or unselective harvesting with balanced or unbalanced fishing, are compared. We find that unselective balanced fishing, where individuals are exploited in proportion to their productivity, produces a slightly larger total maximum sustainable yield than the other exploitation patterns and, for a given yield, the least change in the relative biomass composition of the fish community. Because fishing reduces competition, predation and cannibalism within the community, the total maximum sustainable yield is achieved at high exploitation rates. The yield from unselective balanced fishing is dominated by small individuals, whereas selective fishing produces a much higher proportion of large individuals in the yield. Although unselective balanced fishing is predicted to produce the highest total maximum sustainable yield and the lowest impact on trophic structure, it is effectively a fishery predominantly targeting small forage fish.},

We show that the bleaching responses of corals to a given level of heat exposure differed in each event and were strongly inﬂuenced by contingency and the spatial overlap and strength of interactions between events. Naive regions that escaped bleaching for a decade or longer were the most susceptible to bouts of heat exposure. Conversely, when pairs of successive bleaching episodes were close together (1–3 years apart), the thermal threshold for severe bleaching increased because the earlier event hardened regions of the Great Barrier Reef to further impacts. In the near future, the biological responses to recurrent bleaching events may become stronger as the cumulative geographic footprint expands further, potentially impairing the stock-recruitment relationships among lightly and severely bleached reefs with diverse recent histories. Understanding the emergent properties and collective dynamics of recurrent disturbances will be critical for predicting spatial refuges and cumulative ecological responses, and for managing the longer-term impacts of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems.},

              Coral bleaching occurs when stressful conditions result in the expulsion of the algal partner from the coral. Before anthropogenic climate warming, such events were relatively rare, allowing for recovery of the reef between events. Hughes
              et al.
              looked at 100 reefs globally and found that the average interval between bleaching events is now less than half what it was before. Such narrow recovery windows do not allow for full recovery. Furthermore, warming events such as El Niño are warmer than previously, as are general ocean conditions. Such changes are likely to make it more and more difficult for reefs to recover between stressful events.

            Tropical reef systems are transitioning to a new era in which the interval between recurrent bouts of coral bleaching is too short for a full recovery of mature assemblages. We analyzed bleaching records at 100 globally distributed reef locations from 1980 to 2016. The median return time between pairs of severe bleaching events has diminished steadily since 1980 and is now only 6 years. As global warming has progressed, tropical sea surface temperatures are warmer now during current La Niña conditions than they were during El Niño events three decades ago. Consequently, as we transition to the Anthropocene, coral bleaching is occurring more frequently in all El Niño–Southern Oscillation phases, increasing the likelihood of annual bleaching in the coming decades.},

	abstract = {In 2015–2016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching. In the southern hemisphere summer of March–April 2016, we used aerial surveys to measure the level of bleaching on 1,156 individual reefs throughout the 2,300 km length of the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest coral reef system. The accuracy of the aerial scores was ground-truthed with detailed underwater surveys of bleaching at 260 sites (104 reefs), allowing us to compare aerial and underwater bleaching data with satellite-derived temperatures and with associated model predictions of bleaching. The severity of bleaching on individual reefs in 2016 was tightly correlated with the level of local heat exposure: the southernmost region of the Great Barrier Reef escaped with only minor bleaching because summer temperatures there were close to average. Gradients in nutrients and turbidity from inshore to offshore across the Great Barrier Reef had minimal effect on the severity of bleaching. Similarly, bleaching was equally severe on reefs that are open or closed to fishing, once the level of satellite-derived heat exposure was accounted for. The level of post-bleaching mortality, measured underwater after 7–8 months, was tightly correlated with the aerial scores measured at the peak of bleaching. Similarly, reefs with a high aerial bleaching score also experienced major shifts in species composition due to extensive mortality of heat-sensitive species. Reefs with low bleaching scores did not change in composition, and some showed minor increases in coral cover. Two earlier mass bleaching events occurred on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998 and 2002, that were less severe than 2016. In 2016, {\textless}9\% of scored reefs had no bleaching, compared to 42\% in 2002 and 44\% in 1998. Conversely, the proportion of reefs that were severely bleached ({\textgreater}60\% of corals affected) was four times higher in 2016. The geographic footprint of each of the three events is distinctive, and matches satellite-derived sea surface temperature patterns. Our aerial surveys indicate that past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. This data set of aerial bleaching scores provides a historical baseline for comparison with future bleaching events.

Size spectra were not well approximated by linear ﬁts because of truncation of the size spectra of detritivores. Low primary production resulted in lower abundance of benthic fauna. Bottom trawling reduced the abundance of predators and large detritivores but allowed small detritivores to increase in abundance. These empirical size spectra were partly consistent with predictions from the size spectra model, showing that understanding the structuring of benthic communities requires a consideration of both size and functional group.

The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems.

	abstract = {A general rule in ecology is that the abundance of species or individuals in communities sharing a common energy source decreases with increasing body size. However, external energy inputs in the form of resource subsidies can modify this size spectrum relationship. Here, we provide the first test of how a marine resource subsidy can affect size spectra of terrestrial communities, based on energy derived from Pacific salmon carcasses affecting a forest soil community beside streams in western Canada. Using both species-based and individual approaches, we found size structuring in this forest soil community, and transient community-wide doubling of standing biomass in response to energy pulses from Pacific salmon carcasses. One group of species were clear outliers in the middle of the size spectrum relationship: larval calliphorid and dryomyzid flies, which specialize on salmon carcasses, and which showed a tenfold increase in biomass in their size class when salmon were available. Thus, salmon subsidize their escape from the size spectrum. These results suggest that using a size-based perspective of resource subsidies can provide new insights into the structure and functioning of food webs.},

	abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important ﬁshery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important inﬂuences on biological systems, yet a consistent deﬁnition of MHWs does not exist. A clear deﬁnition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and speciﬁc deﬁnition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally deﬁne a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Speciﬁcally, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for ﬁve or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides ﬂexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia ‘Ningaloo Niño’ in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

	abstract = {It has long been assumed that structural shelter of the appropriate size is a primary limiting resource for coral-reef fishes. We tested two corollaries of this limited shelter hypothesis for fishes occupying 12 concrete-block reefs in a seagrass bed offSt. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Each of three experiments involved six reefs (two replicates of each of three treatments) and lasted up to 27 months. The first corollary was that, holding reef size and hole size constant, rcefs with more holes should support more fishes of that size than rcefs with fewer holes. On recfs with 0, 12, and 24 large holes, the number oflarge resident fishes (squirrclfishes, groupers, and moray eels) increased directly with the abundance of holes. The availability of small shelters (gaps between blocks) was approximately constant on the reefs, so small resident fishes did not show the same pattern. When we subsequently reduced the small shelters on the reefs, the abundance of small fishes declined, especially on reefs where predatory fishes were most numerous, while the abundance oflarge fishes was unaffectcd. The second corollary was that, holding reef size and hole number constant, reefs with small holes (4 x 6 cm) should support more small fishes than reefs with large holes (12 x 14 cm), which should support more large fishes. This prediction was also verified. Beyond the effects of shelter variables, there was a statistically significant negative relationship between the number of resident piscivores and the maximum number of small fishes on any reef. This pattern suggested that piscivores set the upper limit to the number of small fishes on a reef. Overall, it appears that an indirect interaction exists between large shelters and small reef fishes: an increase in the abundance of large shelters causes an increase in the abundance of large piscivorous fishes, which in turn causes a decrease in the local abundance of small prey fishes. This phenomenon suggests that artificial reefs designed for persistent fisheries should include both small holes for small fishes (as refuges from predation) as well as large holes for predatory "target" species (as home sites).},

We use a comprehensive data set extracted from the literature to test the relative explanatory power of two contrasting bodies of ecological theory, the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and ecological stoichiometry (ES), for per-capita and population-level rates of herbivory across ecosystems. We found that ambient temperature and herbivore body size (MTE) as well as stoichiometric mismatch (ES) both constrained herbivory, but at different scales of biological organization. Herbivore body size, which varied over 11 orders of magnitude, was the primary factor explaining variation in per-capita rates of herbivory. Stoichiometric mismatch explained more variation in population-level herbivory rates and also in per-capita rates when we examined data from within functionally similar trophic groups (e.g. zooplankton). Thus, predictions from metabolic and stoichiometric theories offer complementary explanations for patterns of herbivory that operate at different scales of biological organization.},

Although generally supporting the abundant-centre hypothesis, many species also displayed asymmetrical thermal-abundance distributions. For many tropical species, abundances did not decline at warm distribution edges due to an unavailability of warmer environments at the equator.

	abstract = {Theory predicts that bottom-heavy biomass pyramids or ‘stacks’ should predominate in real-world communities if trophic-level increases with body size (mean predator-to-prey mass ratio (PPMR) more than 1). However, recent research suggests that inverted biomass pyramids (IBPs) characterize relatively pristine reef fish communities. Here, we estimated the slope of a kelp forest fish community biomass spectrum from underwater visual surveys. The observed biomass spectrum slope is strongly positive, reflecting an IBP. This is incongruous with theory because this steep positive slope would only be expected if trophic position decreased with increasing body size (consumer-to-resource mass ratio, less than 1). We then used δ

              N signatures of fish muscle tissue to quantify the relationship between trophic position and body size and instead detected strong evidence for the opposite, with PPMR ≈ 1650 (50\% credible interval 280–12 000). The natural history of kelp forest reef fishes suggests that this paradox could arise from energetic subsidies in the form of movement of mobile consumers across habitats, and from seasonally pulsed production inputs at small body sizes. There were four to five times more biomass at large body sizes (1–2 kg) than would be expected in a closed steady-state community providing a measure of the magnitude of subsidies.},

	abstract = {Understanding how habitat complexity shapes fish communities is necessary to predict the consequences of future habitat change. On temperate rocky reefs, the presence and characteristics of canopy-forming kelps and the architectural complexity, or rugosity, of the underlying rocky substratum are foundational elements of habitat complexity. However, it is not yet clear how these factors shape the size structure of rocky-reef-associated fish communities. Here, we use biomass spectrum models to evaluate how fish community size structure in high-latitude rocky-reef kelp forests is shaped by substratum rugosity and the degree of closure and density of the kelp canopy. We found that the presence of a closed kelp canopy was associated with an average 75\% increase in overall fish biomass compared to open-canopy reefs. Furthermore, on the highestrugosity reefs, the biomass of small fishes (32−64 g) was 800\% higher than on the lowest-rugosity reefs, while large fish (1−2 kg) biomass was 60\% lower. Consequently, biomass was more evenly distributed across body-size classes on high-rugosity reefs. By decomposing the biomass spectrum into total biomass and mean individual body mass, we found that higher kelp stipe densities also tended to be associated with larger fishes, but this effect was outweighed by the tendency for more small-bodied fishes with increasing rugosity. This study demonstrates how size-based analyses can give new insights into the ecology of temperate reef communities, and may be useful for tracking changes in kelp-associated assemblages in the coming decades with the maturation of marine protected areas, the recovery of sea otter populations, and changing climate.},

	abstract = {Benthic suspension feeders are functionally important components of many shallow estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Their relative importance in material and energy cycling depends on physical and biological factors, of which population dynamics of individual species are a key feature. We studied the demographics and secondary production of a population of the tubicolous, suspension feeding polychaete, Chaetopterus cf. variopedatus, of southern Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, to better understand its functional role in an estuarine ecosystem. Average worm densities in the study region ranged from 30 to {\textgreater}1000 individuals m-2 and were greatest after the summer recruitment period. Recruitment success varied threefold between 1994 and 1995. A two-cohort model (juveniles and adults) with seasonality best described the data. High secondary production (18 g C m-2 yr-' in 1994, 34 g C m-2 yr-' in 1995) was mainly due to rapid growth and maturation of new recruits during summer and tube production. An interannual difference in production was associated with the interannual difference in recruitment success. General temporal trends of primary production and worm production were similar, and the worm population required 35\%-100\% of the estimated annual net water column community production per m2 for this region of the estuary. Chaetopterus cf. variopedatus is an important component of the lower bay ecosystem and should be considered when modeling carbon, nutrient, and energy flow. Our results further demonstrate that temporal variations in population dynamics lead to significant temporal variability in the relative importance of benthic suspension feeder effects for ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {A general question in biology is how processes at one scale, for example that of individual organisms, influence patterns at larger scales, for example communities of interacting individuals. Here we ask how changing the size-dependence of the foraging behaviour of individuals can influence the structure of food webs. We assembled communities using a model in which species interactions are determined by allometric foraging rules of (i) handling time and (ii) attack rates, and also (iii) the distribution of body sizes. We systematically varied these three factors and examined their effects on three community level, food web allometries: the generality - mass correlation, the vulnerability - mass correlation and the trophic height - mass correlation. The results demonstrate how allometries of individual foraging behaviour (handling time and attack rates) are linked across scales of organisation: different community level allometries are influenced by different individual level allometries. For example, generality allometries in the community are most affected by the individual allometric relationships of the attack rate, whereas trophic level allometries in the community are more strongly influenced by variation in individual handling time allometries. Importantly, we also find that the shape of the body size distribution from which species are drawn has a substantial influence on how these links between scales operate. This study suggests that understanding the variation of size structure among ecological networks requires knowledge about the causes of variation in individual foraging behaviour and determinants of the regional body size distribution.},

          Recent research provides an unprecedented account of the diversity and biomass of life, but the data also suggest unexplained patterns such as the co-dominance of very different life forms. We compile the planetary body size biomass spectrum across all taxa and investigate possible underlying forces. We find that small (10-14 g) and large (106 g) organisms vastly outweigh other sizes. The global spectrum reveals an allometric power exponent close to zero, with the marine spectrum in particular showing multiple closely packed modes that are compatible with metabolic food webs. All habitat realms share two distinct size modes that correspond well to the evolutionary innovations of unicellular and complex multicellular life forms, plus a smaller third mode representing unicellular endosymbiotic life. Each mode contains both producers and consumers. These findings show both differences and similarities across habitat realms and point to a size-based synthesis of microevolution, macroevolution, and macroecology.},

            Fishing marine ecosystems indiscriminately and intensely can have negative impacts on biodiversity, but it may increase the biomass of fish available for capture in the system. We explore the possibility that China’s high fishery catches are a result of predator removal using an ecosystem model of the East China Sea (ECS). We show that China’s high fishery catches can be explained by the removal of larger predatory fish and consequent increases in the production of smaller fish. We project that single-species management would decrease catches in the ECS by reversing these ecosystem effects. Fisheries similar to those in China produce a large fraction of global catch; management reform in these areas must consider the entire ecosystem, rather than individual species.
          , 
            Indiscriminate and intense fishing has occurred in many marine ecosystems around the world. Although this practice may have negative effects on biodiversity and populations of individual species, it may also increase total fishery productivity by removing predatory fish. We examine the potential for this phenomenon to explain the high reported wild catches in the East China Sea—one of the most productive ecosystems in the world that has also had its catch reporting accuracy and fishery management questioned. We show that reported catches can be approximated using an ecosystem model that allows for trophic cascades (i.e., the depletion of predators and consequent increases in production of their prey). This would be the world’s largest known example of marine ecosystem “engineering” and suggests that trade-offs between conservation and food production exist. We project that fishing practices could be modified to increase total catches, revenue, and biomass in the East China Sea, but single-species management would decrease both catches and revenue by reversing the trophic cascades. Our results suggest that implementing single-species management in currently lightly managed and highly exploited multispecies fisheries (which account for a large fraction of global fish catch) may result in decreases in global catch. Efforts to reform management in these fisheries will need to consider system wide impacts of changes in management, rather than focusing only on individual species.},

We tested the common perception that commercial and recreational ﬁshing on inshore temperate reefs generate spatial impacts that diminish with distance from ﬁsher access points. We collected data on harvested and non-harvested reef species using underwater visual censuses at 133 shallow rocky reef sites around Tasmania and tested for relationships between assemblage and species level indices of ﬁshing impacts and distance to the nearest boat launching ramp. Slopes of size spectra of ﬁsh communities tended to decrease with distance from the nearest boat ramp, with this relationship apparently resulting from low numbers of large ﬁsh (N 30 cm TL) and a greater number of smaller ﬁsh (b 15 cm TL) at sites closest to access points. At the species level, relationships were evident either in the abundance of legal individuals or the mean size of harvested species with distance to the nearest boat ramp, except for rock lobster. Patterns for rock lobster differed when areas in which commercial or recreational ﬁsheries dominated were considered separately from the statewide analysis. A pattern of increasing numbers of legal lobsters with increasing distance from boat ramps was observed, but only in the areas in which the recreational ﬁshery dominated. Observed relationships in all species were consistent with greater ﬁshing impacts at sites closest to boat ramps, with the exception of exploited wrasses. Banded morwong, which are subject to a live export ﬁshery, appeared to be most affected by proximity to boat ramps. Conversely, no relationships were found between the abundance or size of the most frequently occurring non-harvested species and distance to boat ramps.},

	abstract = {Species richness increases with energy availability, yet there is little consensus as to the exact processes driving this species–energy relationship. The most straightforward explanation is the moreindividuals hypothesis (MIH). It states that higher energy availability promotes a higher total number of individuals in a community, which consequently increases species richness by allowing for a greater number of species with viable populations. Empirical support for the MIH is mixed, partially due to the lack of proper formalisation of the MIH and consequent confusion as to its exact predictions. Here, we review the evidence of the MIH and evaluate the reliability of various predictions that have been tested. There is only limited evidence that spatial variation in species richness is driven by variation in the total number of individuals. There are also problems with measures of energy availability, with scale-dependence, and with the direction of causality, as the total number of individuals may sometimes itself be driven by the number of species. However, even in such a case the total number of individuals may be involved in diversity regulation. We propose a formal theory that encompasses these processes, clarifying how the different factors affecting diversity dynamics can be disentangled.},

	abstract = {Many fish species are cryptic by nature or show a negative response to divers. This may make traditional censusing techniques difficult to perform and the results obtained using these methods may be inaccurate. This problem will be exacerbated in complex habitats, such as those found on coral reefs, because the cryptic species present will be even more difficult to locate and identify. Predation studies on coral reefs have been especially hampered by this problem because many predatory species are cryptic and so it has been difficult to obtain reliable abundance estimates. This study tested a visual census technique that used bait to bring cryptic predatory fish into view. Results from this census were then compared to those from a traditional survey using belt transects, and to a patch reef tagging study where all individuals of 3 key species were located. The baited technique produced significantly higher density estimates for 3 of the 4 most abundant cryptic species. The patch reef experiment demonstrated that the baited technique accounted for 85 to 96\% of fish present. Censuses without bait observed only 40 to 61\% of fish present. For mobile species, on the other hand, the baited census appeared to overestimate abundance, due to movement of fish into the census area. We therefore recommend combining baited censuses of sedentary cryptic species with traditional censuses of mobile species to gain a n accurate picture of piscivorous reef fish communities. Using this approach at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef, the proportion of cryptic piscivores in the community was found to be almost double that which would have otherwise been observed. We also found considerable spatial variation in the abundance and distribution of piscivorous fish. These patterns would have been quite different had the survey been based on belt transects alone. Previous studies using belt transects may therefore have underestimated the importance of cryptic piscivorous species in communities of coral reef fish.},

This hypothesis assumes that communities are limited by productivity. We tested the More Individuals Hypothesis using the detritivorous aquatic insect communities of tree holes. When tree holes with varying levels of productivity (debris amount) were allowed to be colonized (through oviposition), more productive tree holes did have more species but not more individuals. Neither was total energy use strictly proportional to productivity. Only in communities forced to disassemble through productivity reductions were the predictions of the More Individuals Hypothesis satisﬁed. Ovipositing adults may prefer productive tree holes not because they contain more resources but because they are anticipated to be less likely to dry out. In tree holes, and more generally, the More Individuals Hypothesis is an insufﬁcient explanation for increases in species richness with productivity because it neither accounts for the different processes of local colonization and extinction nor allows body size to correlate with extinction risk.},

It is different from the "flat" spectra characteristic of the surface waters of equatorial and subtropical oceans, and of all oceans at depth. The ratio of phytoplankton/zooplankton biomass in lakes ranges from 0.04 to 597.0, with most values falling within the range of 0.5–3.33 predicted for marine pelagic communities. Particle-size theory predictions of fish standing stock in two study lakes compare quite well to the actual fish biomass measured in the lakes. In contrast to the linear relation between phytoplankton and fish stocks predicted by the theory, a curvilinear relationship exists, suggesting that overall ecosystem productivity may influence particle-size patterns. To facilitate further comparisons between marine and freshwater ecosystems, we argue that additional information on the effects of spatial heterogeneity, nonliving particulate matter, automated measurement techniques, and benthic–pelagic coupling on particle-size distributions is required.},

Residual variation around the fitted straight lines (corresponding to a theoretical steady state) was least for the large, oligotrophic Lake Superior and the North Pacific Gyre and greatest for eutrophic Saginaw Bay and shallow Lake Erie, suggesting progressive departure from steady-state conditions with increasing system productivity. The slopes of the normalized spectra decrease with increasing eutrophy, indicating that nannoplankton abundances are similar in all communities studied, but that associated zooplankton abundances vary by 2.5 orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that parameterization of particle-size models for prediction of potential fish production must be adjusted according to the size and productivity of the ecosystem, and that routine monitoring of communities by the normalized biomass spectrum could provide early warning of nutrient or toxic stress in aquatic ecosystems.},

We confirm these assertions by showing that parabolas provide good models of normalized biomass as a function of body mass within homogeneous trophic groupings of organisms (phytoplankton, zooplankton, or fish) in the pelagic food webs of Lakes Ontario and Michigan.

	abstract = {Charles Elton introduced the “pyramid of numbers” in the late 1920s, but this remarkable insight into body-size dependent patterns in natural communities lay fallow until the theory of the biomass size spectrum was introduced by aquatic ecologists in the mid-1960s. They noticed that the summed biomass concentration of individual aquatic organisms was roughly constant across equal logarithmic intervals of body size from bacteria to the largest predators. These observations formed the basis for a theory of aquatic ecosystems, based on the body size of individual organisms, that revealed new insights into constraints on the structure of biological communities. In this review, we discuss the history of the biomass spectrum and the development of underlying theories. We indicate how to construct biomass spectra from sample data, explain the mathematical relations among them, show empirical examples of their various forms, and give details on how to statistically ﬁt the most robust linear and nonlinear models to biomass spectra. We ﬁnish by giving examples of biomass spectrum applications to production and ﬁsheries ecology and offering recommendations to help standardize use of the biomass spectrum in aquatic ecology.},

They are intermediate-complexity ecological models that are solutions to partial differential equations driven by the size-dependent processes of predation, growth, mortality, and reproduction in a community of interacting species and sizes. To be useful for quantitative ﬁsheries management these models need to be developed further in a formal statistical framework. Previous work has used time-averaged data to “calibrate” the model using optimization methods with the disadvantage of losing detailed time-series information. Using a published multispecies size spectrum model parameterized for the North Sea comprising 12 interacting ﬁsh species and a background resource, we ﬁt the model to time-series data using a Bayesian framework for the ﬁrst time. We capture the 1967–2010 period using annual estimates of ﬁshing mortality rates as input to the model and time series of ﬁsheries landings data to ﬁt the model to output. We estimate 38 key parameters representing the carrying capacity of each species and background resource, as well as initial inputs of the dynamical system and errors on the model output. We then forecast the model forward to evaluate how uncertainty propagates through to population- and community-level indicators under alternative management strategies.},

Here we report on a new global system for coastal and shelf areas: the Marine Ecoregions of the World, or MEOW, a nested system of 12 realms, 62 provinces, and 232 ecoregions. This system provides considerably better spatial resolution than earlier global systems, yet it preserves many common elements and can be cross-referenced to many regional biogeographic classifications.

	abstract = {Predicting diet of animals in ecological communities is necessary for a better understanding of trophic links and piecing together food webs to inform ecosystem-based management. A dietary model, Consume, was recently developed to predict detailed dietary information for ﬁshes on the basis of ﬁsh identity and size. This model was ﬁeld-tested over a continental scale, predicting community-level consumption for other temperate marine ﬁsh communities that differed in species composition and size structure. Using local stomach contents data to ﬁeld-test predictions, accurate performance of the model was found across 14 locations around southern Australia. Prey type and mean prey size were predicted for ﬁshes at new locations with high accuracy (mean percentage overlap between predicted and actual prey types = 73\%; r2 between predicted and observed mean prey size = 89\%) when trained with stomach contents data from subsets of sampled ﬁshes at all locations. Model accuracy dropped, but was still respectable, when using training data only from one location (prey type accuracy = 67\%; mean prey size r2 = 56\%). Prey type was more accurately predicted on the basis of consumer body size than species identity, while consumer family identity and size were needed for accurate prediction of mean prey size. The most important factors were evaluated by leaving out predictors (species, genus and family identity; size of consumer; habitat, location, ecoregion and biogeographic province). Exclusion of geographical location information resulted in little loss in accuracy. Our results highlight the need for consideration of consumer body size in trophic models, rather than binning species into functional groups solely on the basis of taxonomy. Application of Consume to situations where no dietary information exists, but at least ﬁsh family identity and size structure are known, will provide a novel mechanism for testing important ecological hypotheses and assessing trophic consequences of anthropogenically-induced changes in community structure.},

The model, nicknamed ‘Consume’, was used to assess the relative extent to which fish diet varied with body size, species identity, season, and location. Both prey type (mean overlap between predicted and actual prey types = 77\%) and mean prey size (r2 between predicted and observed mean prey size = 93\%) were predicted with reasonable accuracy when species identity and length of consumer fish were known. The most important predictor for prey type was the size of the individual consumer, while the most important predictor for mean prey size was the consumer’s taxonomic identity. Predictors were individually removed from both k-nearest neighbour and linear models to assess their relative contributions to the model. Little loss of accuracy (1\%) was evident when family rather than species identity was used for both prey type and mean prey size. Environmental information associated with the time and location of fish sampling (habitat, site and season) contributed only marginally to predictions of prey type. Use of the Consume model will allow for an improved understanding of community-level trophic pathways through the integration of prey type and size predictions for consumer fishes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The usefulness and relevance of size-based indicators (SBIs) to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are assessed through a review of empirical and modelling studies. SBIs are tabulated along with their definitions, data requirements, potential biases, availability of time-series, and expected directions of change in response to fishing pressure. They include mean length in a population, mean length in a community, mean maximum length in a community, and the slope and intercept of size spectra. Most SBIs can be derived from fairly standard survey data on length frequencies, without the need for elaborate models. Possible fishing- and environment-induced effects are analysed to distinguish between the two causes, and hypothetical cases of reference directions of change are tabulated. We conclude that no single SBI can serve as an effective overall indicator of heavy fishing pressure. Rather, suites of SBI should be selected, and reference directions may be more useful than reference points. Further modelling and worldwide comparative studies are needed to provide better understanding of SBIs and the factors affecting them. The slow response to fishing pressure reflects the complexity of community interactions and ecosystem responses, and prohibits their application in the context of short-term (annual) tactical fisheries management. However, movement towards longer-term (5–10 years) strategic management in EAF should facilitate their use.},

	abstract = {For most fish species, strong environmental constraints imposed by living in an aquatic medium have produced converging streamlined body forms without prehensile appendices. This similarity in body shapes highlights a common predation constraint: a predatory fish must have a jaw large enough to swallow its prey. Fish diets may then reflect local prey availability and predator–prey size ratios. Based on this size-based opportunistic predation process, the multispecies individual-based model OSMOSE (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine ecOSystem Exploitation) is used to investigate to what extent the size distribution of fish communities can contribute to better our understanding of the functioning of marine food webs and the ecosystem effects of fishing. Strong similarity in shape is found between simulated size spectra and those described in empirical studies. The existence of a curvature towards small size classes is discussed in the light of the size-based predation hypothesis, which implies that smaller fish may undergo higher predation mortality. Applying linear and quadratic regressions to the simulated size spectra allows the detection of variations in fishing pressure and the proposal of different ways to quantify them. In particular, it is shown that the slope of the size spectrum decreases quasilinearly with fishing mortality and that the curvature could help to detect ecosystem overexploitation.},

Separate equations were derived for meiofauna and macrofauna. Since no published data on production and size-structure in natural bacterial populations were found, P : B ratios for bacteria were calculated by extrapolation from an all-inclusive regression. In situ respiration was then calculated from production assuming the two to be approximately equal over an annual cycle for bacteria and benthc microalgae, and using an empirical relation between annual respiration and production in marine benthic animals for meiofauna and macrofauna. Monthly observations of benthic biomass spectra at Pecks Cove, an intertidal site in the upper Bay of Fundy, were used to estimate production and respiration in bacteria, microalgae, meiofauna, and macrofauna from the allometric equations. These estimates compared well with measured production for Corophjum volutator and Macoma balthjca, the 2 dominant macrofaunal species, and w {\textasciitilde} t hgross primary production by benthic microalgae, but not with total community respiration as measured by sediment oxygen consumption. Calculated values for production by bactena were of an expected magnitude {\textasciitilde}f between 1 and 10 O/O of the total biomass was assumed to be active. The contribution of meiofauna and macrofauna to total community production (8 to 19 \%, depending on the assumphon for bacterial achvity) was d{\textasciitilde}sproportionately small compared to their relahve biomass (47 to 52 \%, also depending on what proportion of bacterial biomass was considered to be actlve). Estimates of respiration were much higher than measured rates of sediment oxygen consurnphon (2.5 to 5.5 times), although both followed closely sirmlar seasonal trends. Bacterial produchon in nature must be directly measured before the validity of our calculations can be assessed.

	abstract = {Modelling populations on an individual-by-individual basis has proven to be a fruitful approach. Many complex patterns that are observed on the population level have been shown to arise from simple interactions between individuals. However, a major problem with these models is that the typically large number of individuals needed requires impractically large computation times. The common solution, reduction of the number of individuals in the model, can lead to loss of variation, irregular dynamics, and large sensitivity to the value of random generator seeds. As a solution to these problems, we propose to add an extra variable feature to each model individual, namely the number of real individuals it actually represents. This approach allows zooming from a real individual-by-individual model to a cohort representation or ultimately an all-animals-are-equal view without changing the model formulation. Therefore, the super-individual concept offers easy possibilities to check whether the observed behaviour is an artifact of following a limited number of individuals or of lumping individuals, and also to verify whether individual variability is indeed an essential ingredient for the observed behaviour. In addition the approach offers arbitrarily large computational advantages. As an example the super-individual approach is applied to a generic model of the dynamics of a size-distributed consumer cohort as well as to an elaborate applied simulation model of the recruitment of striped bass.},

Regression analysis was used to illustrate interspecific variation in ontogenetic patterns of prey size use, gape allometries, and ratio-based trophic niche breadths. Sizebased feeding strategies were assessed through comparison of frequency distributions of relative prey sizes eaten and were related to general predator feeding tactics and gape morphology. The results demonstrated that the range of prey sizes eaten expanded with increasing predator body size for each of the marine predators examined, leading to asymmetric predator size - prey size distributions. Absolute maximum prey size and slopes of maximum prey size versus predator size varied widely among predator taxa. Distinct size-based feeding strategies were evident, as diets of some predators were dominated by prey that were 10 to 20\% of predator size, whereas other predators frequently consumed prey {\textgreater} 50\% of predator size. Gape sizes and allometric relationships with body size were also diverse among predators and often were closely associated with maximum prey sizes. Ratio-based trophic-niche breadths generally did not expand with predator ontogeny and tended to narrow for the largest predators, which may be common for animal taxa.},

Most coral reefs are moderately to severely degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well as global change, hence it is difficult to separate local from global effects. To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming.},

Here we analyze such picoplankton to mesozooplankton size spectra along a 50uN to 50uS transect in the Atlantic. Contrary to common perception, the transfer efficiency in the oceans is not related to ecosystem productivity. Our results challenge the view that biomass transfer efficiency is lower in oligotrophic oceanic ecosystems.

With the number of reported cases quickly growing, key features and commonalities have emerged. Fishery-induced trophic cascades often display differential response times and nonlinear trajectories among trophic levels and can be accompanied by shifts in alternative states. Furthermore, their magnitude appears to be context dependent, varying as a function of species diversity, regional oceanography, local physical disturbance, habitat complexity, and the nature of the fishery itself. To conserve and manage exploited marine ecosystems, there is a pressing need for an improved understanding of the conditions that promote or inhibit the cascading consequences of fishing. Future research should investigate how the trophic effects of fishing interact with other human disturbances, identify strongly interacting species and ecosystem features that confer resilience to exploitation, determine ranges of predator depletion that elicit trophic cascades, pinpoint antecedents that signal ecosystem state shifts, and quantify variation in trophic rates across oceanographic conditions. This information will advance predictive models designed to forecast the trophic effects of fishing and will allow managers to better anticipate and avoid fishery-induced trophic cascades.},

A dynamic size-structured model is developed for phytoplankton and nutrients in the oceanic mixed layer and applied to extract phytoplankton biomass at discrete size fractions from remotely sensed, ocean-colour data. General relationships between cell size and biophysical processes (such as sinking, grazing, and primary production) of phytoplankton were included in the model through a bottom–up approach. Time-dependent, mixed-layer depth was used as a forcing variable, and a sequential data-assimilation scheme was implemented to derive model trajectories. From a given time-series, the method produces estimates of size-structured biomass at every observation, so estimates seasonal succession of individual phytoplankton size, derived here from remote sensing for the first time. From these estimates, normalized phytoplankton biomass size spectra over a period of 9 years were calculated for one location in the North Atlantic. Further analysis demonstrated that strong relationships exist between the seasonal trends of the estimated size spectra and the mixed-layer depth, nutrient biomass, and total chlorophyll. The results contain useful information on the time-dependent biomass flux in the pelagic ecosystem.},

            We independently reconstructed vessels number, engine power, and effort of the global marine fishing fleet, in both the artisanal and industrial sectors. Although global fishing capacity and effort have more than doubled since 1950 in all but the most industrialized regions, the nominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) has comparatively decreased. Between 1950 and 2015 the effective CPUE, among the most widely used indicator to assess fisheries management and stocks well being, has decreased by over 80\% for most countries. This paper highlights the large differences in the development of sectorial fishing fleets regionally. This detailed paper empowers future exploration of the drivers of these changes, critical to develop sector and regionally specific management models targeting global fisheries sustainability.
          , 
            Previous reconstructions of marine fishing fleets have aggregated data without regard to the artisanal and industrial sectors. Engine power has often been estimated from subsets of the developed world, leading to inflated results. We disaggregated data into three sectors, artisanal (unpowered/powered) and industrial, and reconstructed the evolution of the fleet and its fishing effort. We found that the global fishing fleet doubled between 1950 and 2015—from 1.7 to 3.7 million vessels. This has been driven by substantial expansion of the motorized fleet, particularly, of the powered-artisanal fleet. By 2015, 68\% of the global fishing fleet was motorized. Although the global fleet is dominated by small powered vessels under 50 kW, they contribute only 27\% of the global engine power, which has increased from 25 to 145 GW (combined powered-artisanal and industrial fleets). Alongside an expansion of the fleets, the effective catch per unit of effort (CPUE) has consistently decreased since 1950, showing the increasing pressure of fisheries on ocean resources. The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries, challenging sustainable use of fisheries' resources.},

            In ecological communities, especially the pelagic zones of aquatic ecosystems, certain body-size ranges are often over-represented compared to others. Community size spectra, the distributions of community biomass over the logarithmic body-mass axis, tend to exhibit regularly spaced local maxima, called “domes”, separated by steep troughs. Contrasting established theory, we explain these dome patterns as manifestations of top-down trophic cascades along aquatic food chains. Compiling high quality size-spectrum data and comparing these with a size-spectrum model introduced in this study, we test this theory and develop a detailed picture of the mechanisms by which bottom-up and top-down effects interact to generate dome patterns. Results imply that strong top-down trophic cascades are common in freshwater communities, much more than hitherto demonstrated, and may arise in nutrient rich marine systems as well. Transferring insights from the general theory of non-linear pattern formation to domes patterns, we provide new interpretations of past lake-manipulation experiments.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have long searched for structures and processes that impart stability in nature. In particular, food web ecology has held promise in tackling this issue. Empirical patterns in food webs have consistently shown that the distributions of species and interactions in nature are more likely to be stable than randomly constructed systems with the same number of species and interactions. Food web ecology still faces two fundamental challenges, however. First, the quantity and quality of food web data required to document both the species richness and the interaction strengths among all species within food webs is largely prohibitive. Second, where food webs have been well documented, spatial and temporal variation in food web structure has been ignored. Conversely, research that has addressed spatial and temporal variation in ecosystems has generally ignored the full complexity of food web architecture. Here, we incorporate empirical patterns, largely from macroecology and behavioural ecology, into a spatially implicit food web structure to construct a simple landscape theory of food web architecture. Such an approach both captures important architectural features of food webs and allows for an exploration of food web structure across a range of spatial scales. Finally, we demonstrated that food webs are hierarchically organized along the spatial and temporal niche axes of species and their utilization of food resources in ways that stabilize ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs face a diverse array of threats, from eutrophication and overﬁshing to climate change. As live corals are lost and their skeletons eroded, the structural complexity of reefs declines. This may have important consequences for the survival and growth of reef ﬁsh because complex habitats mediate predator-prey interactions [1, 2] and inﬂuence competition [3–5] through the provision of prey refugia. A positive correlation exists between structural complexity and reef ﬁsh abundance and diversity in both temperate and tropical ecosystems [6–10]. However, it is not clear how the diversity of available refugia interacts with individual predator-prey relationships to explain emergent properties at the community scale. Furthermore, we do not yet have the ability to predict how habitat loss might affect the productivity of whole reef communities and the ﬁsheries they support. Using data from an unﬁshed reserve in The Bahamas, we ﬁnd that structural complexity is associated not only with increased ﬁsh biomass and abundance, but also with nonlinearities in the size spectra of ﬁsh, implying disproportionately high abundances of certain size classes. By developing a size spectrum food web model that links the vulnerability of prey to predation with the structural complexity of a reef, we show that these nonlinearities can be explained by size-structured prey refugia that reduce mortality rates and alter growth rates in different parts of the size spectrum. Fitting the model with data from a structurally complex habitat, we predict that a loss of complexity could cause more than a 3-fold reduction in ﬁshery productivity.},

When reef structural complexity is lost, refuge density declines and prey vulnerability increases. Here, we explore whether the presence of nursery habitats can promote high predator productivity on degraded reefs by mitigating the costs of increased vulnerability in early life, whilst allowing for the benefits of increased food availability in adulthood. We apply size-based ecosystem models of coral reefs with high and low structural complexity to predict fish biomass and productivity in the presence and absence of mangrove nurseries. Our scenarios allow us to elucidate the interacting effects of refuge availability and ontogenetic habitat shifts for fisheries productivity. We find that low complexity, degraded reefs with nurseries can support fisheries productivity that is equal to or greater than that in complex reefs that lack nurseries.},

	abstract = {Wild-­caught fish are a bioavailable source of nutritious food that, if managed strategically, could enhance diet quality for billions of people. However, optimising nutrient production from the sea has not been a priority, hindering development of nutrition-­ sensitive policies. With fisheries management increasingly effective at rebuilding stocks and regulating sustainable fishing, we can now begin to integrate nutritional outcomes within existing management frameworks. Here, we develop a conceptual foundation for managing fisheries for multispecies Maximum Nutrient Yield (mMNY). We empirically test our approach using size-­based models of North Sea and Baltic Sea fisheries and show that mMNY is predicted by the relative contribution of nutritious species to total catch and their vulnerability to fishing, leading to trade-­offs between catch and specific nutrients. Simulated nutrient yield curves suggest that vitamin D, which is deficient in Northern European diets, was underfished at fishing levels that returned maximum catch weights. Analysis of global catch data shows there is scope for nutrient yields from most of the world's marine fisheries to be enhanced through nutrient-­sensitive fisheries management. With nutrient composition data now widely available, we expect our mMNY framework to motivate development of nutrient-­ based reference points in specific contexts, such as data-­limited fisheries. Managing for mMNY alongside policies that promote access to fish could help close nutrient gaps for coastal populations, maximising the contribution of wild-­caught fish to global food and nutrition security.},

For continuous ocean habitats this reorganization is characterized by large‐scale species redistribution, but for tropical discontinuous habitats such as coral reefs, spatial isolation coupled with strong habitat dependence of fish species imply that turnover and local extinctions are more significant mechanisms. In these systems, transient marine heatwaves are causing coral bleaching and profoundly altering habitat structure, yet despite severe bleaching events becoming more frequent and projections indicating annual severe bleaching by the 2050s at most reefs, long‐term effects on the diversity and structure of fish assemblages remain unclear. Using a 23‐year time series spanning a thermal stress event, we describe and model structural changes and recovery trajectories of fish communities after mass bleaching. Communities changed fundamentally, with the new emergent communities dominated by herbivores and persisting for {\textgreater}15 years, a period exceeding realized and projected intervals between thermal stress events on coral reefs. Reefs which shifted to macroalgal states had the lowest species richness and highest compositional dissimilarity, whereas reefs where live coral recovered exceeded prebleaching fish richness, but remained dissimilar to prebleaching compositions. Given realized and projected frequencies of bleaching events, our results show that fish communities historically associated with coral reefs will not re‐establish, requiring substantial adaptation by managers and resource users.},

	abstract = {Fishing pressure on coral reef ecosystems has been frequently linked to reductions of large ﬁshes and reef ﬁsh biomass. Associated impacts on overall community structure are, however, less clear. In size-structured aquatic ecosystems, ﬁshing impacts are commonly quantiﬁed using size spectra, which describe the distribution of individual body sizes within a community. We examined the size spectra and biomass of coral reef ﬁsh communities at 38 USafﬁliated Paciﬁc islands that ranged in human presence from near pristine to human population centers. Size spectra ‘steepened’ steadily with increasing human population and proximity to market due to a reduction in the relative biomass of large ﬁshes and an increase in the dominance of small ﬁshes. Reef ﬁsh biomass was substantially lower on inhabited islands than uninhabited ones, even at inhabited islands with the lowest levels of human presence. We found that on populated islands size spectra exponents decreased (analogous to size spectra steepening) linearly with declining biomass, whereas on uninhabited islands there was no relationship. Size spectra were steeper in regions of low sea surface temperature but were insensitive to variation in other environmental and geomorphic covariates. In contrast, reef ﬁsh biomass was highly sensitive to oceanographic conditions, being inﬂuenced by both oceanic productivity and sea surface temperature. Our results suggest that community size structure may be a more robust indicator than ﬁsh biomass to increasing human presence and that size spectra are reliable indicators of exploitation impacts across regions of different ﬁsh community compositions, environmental drivers, and ﬁsheries types. Sizebased approaches that link directly to functional properties of ﬁsh communities, and are relatively insensitive to abiotic variation across biogeographic regions, offer great potential for developing our understanding of ﬁshing impacts in coral reef ecosystems.},

Here, we use underwater visual-census data and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to test if coral reef ﬁsh communities (i) are size structured and (ii) follow metabolic scaling rules. After examining individuals from over 160 species spanning four orders of magnitude in body size, we show that abundance scaled negatively with body size and, as predicted, individuals sharing energy through predation (carnivorous ﬁshes) scaled more steeply than those individuals sharing a common energy source (herbivorous ﬁshes). Estimated size spectra were, however, shallower than predicted by metabolic theory. Trophic position scaled positively with body size across species and across individuals, providing novel evidence of size structuring in a diverse tropical food web. Size-based approaches hold great promise for integrating the complexities of food webs into simple quantitative measures, thus providing new insights into the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems.},

Here we present morphometric (length–weight) relationships for 216 benthic species from the North Sea to permit weight estimation from length measurements. These relationships were calculated using data collected over two years from 283 stations. For ten abundant and widely dispersed species we tested for significant spatial and temporal differences in morphometric relationships. Some were found, but the magnitude of differences was small in relation to the size-ranges of animals that are usually present and we recommend that the regression relationships given here, based on pooled data, are appropriate for most types of population and community analyses. Our hope is that the availability of these morphometric relationships will encourage the more frequent application of size-based analyses to benthic survey data, and so enhance understanding of the ecology of the benthic/demersal component of marine ecosystems and food webs.},

Very different types of scaling have been studied, based on either individuals or species. The individual size distribution (ISD) describes the distribution of individual-organism body masses regardless of taxonomy, and contains the same information as the abundance spectrum. Focusing instead on species, the local size–density relationship (LSDR) plots population densities vs. mean body masses of species. The distribution of species mean body masses (the species-mean-size distribution, SMSD) is also important but previously little studied in webs. We here combine and formalize theory of several authors to predict: how these three descriptions are related; the forms of the LSDR and ISD; and variation in scaling among webs. We describe empirically the SMSDs of two pelagic, one estuarine, and 146 soil webs by power laws and generalizations. We test theory and find it broadly validated.},

          , 
            Human activities drive environmental changes at scales that could potentially cause ecosystem collapses in the marine environment. We combined information on marine biodiversity with spatial assessments of the impacts of climate change to identify the key areas to prioritize for the conservation of global marine biodiversity. This process identified six marine regions of exceptional biodiversity based on global distributions of 1729 species of fish, 124 marine mammals, and 330 seabirds. Overall, these hot spots of marine biodiversity coincide with areas most severely affected by global warming. In particular, these marine biodiversity hot spots have undergone local to regional increasing water temperatures, slowing current circulation, and decreasing primary productivity. Furthermore, when we overlapped these hot spots with available industrial fishery data, albeit coarser than our estimates of climate impacts, they suggest a worrying coincidence whereby the world’s richest areas for marine biodiversity are also those areas mostly affected by both climate change and industrial fishing. In light of these findings, we offer an adaptable framework for determining local to regional areas of special concern for the conservation of marine biodiversity. This has exposed the need for finer-scaled fishery data to assist in the management of global fisheries if the accumulative, but potentially preventable, effect of fishing on climate change impacts is to be minimized within areas prioritized for marine biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Despite two centuries of exploration, our understanding of factors determining the distribution of life on Earth is in many ways still in its infancy. Much of the disagreement about governing processes of variation in species richness may be the result of differences in our perception of species-richness patterns. Until recently, most studies of large-scale species-richness patterns assumed implicitly that patterns and mechanisms were scale invariant. Illustrated with examples and a quantitative analysis of published data on altitudinal gradients of species richness (n ¼ 204), this review discusses how scale effects (extent and grain size) can influence our perception of patterns and processes. For example, a hump-shaped altitudinal species-richness pattern is the most typical (c. 50\%), with a monotonic decreasing pattern (c. 25\%) also frequently reported, but the relative distribution of patterns changes readily with spatial grain and extent. If we are to attribute relative impact to various factors influencing species richness and distribution and to decide at which point along a spatial and temporal continuum they act, we should not ask only how results vary as a function of scale but also search for consistent patterns in these scale effects. The review concludes with suggestions of potential routes for future analytical exploration of species-richness patterns.},

We found that the relationship between trophic level and body size for the whole macrobenthic community was not significant (r2 = 0.08, p {\textgreater} 0.05), probably associated with biomass accumulated in the larger body size fractions, which are represented particularly by suspension feeders such as sponges and tunicates. We used an alternative method of studying trophic structure of the aquatic communities based on the distribution of residuals of the NBSS. Here we demonstrate how residual distribution exhibited dome-like patterns, which may offer an additional quantitative tool for studying the relationship between trophic level and body size. These domes of biomass represent trophic positions derived from relationships between the body size distribution of the predators in one trophic position and their prey in another. We found 4 well defined domes of biomass, which appear when large benthic species are abundant, especially favored in an environment with high organic matter flux. A significant positive relationship (r2 = 0.59, p {\textless} 0.05) between the trophic level and residuals derived from NBSS suggests that these domes might be considered as functional groups comprising organisms from different trophic levels. We suggest that dome-like patterns in the biomass size spectra can provide a robust framework for conceptualizing and statistically modeling trophic levels of macrobenthic communities.},

The macrobenthic communities were dominated by small-bodied polychaetes (Paraonidae, Capitellidae and Cirratulidae) characterized by continuous year-round breeding, short life-spans, and fast turnover rates, which in turn regulated the standing stock in the communities. Principal component analysis and multiple-regression analysis demonstrate the distribution of macrobenthic communities in the study area to be mainly controlled by few local environmental conditions. Macrofaunal densities, diversity and feeding modes were signiﬁcantly correlated with the total organic carbon (TOC; R2 ¼ 0.74; P , 0.001) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a; R2 ¼ 0.55; P , 0.05) content in the sediments. This study also suggests that feeding modes and NBSS can be used to detect and follow possible changes caused by natural perturbations such as glacial lake outburst ﬂoods or anthropogenic stressors associated with ecological impacts generated by the construction and operation of hydroelectric power stations in the Baker River.},

	abstract = {It may seem surprising that there are conservation laws in ecology as in physics, although these laws are less accurate than in physics and hold only on average, i.e., on large spatial scales (macroecology). One such law is the biomass equivalence rule, which was proposed by Sheldon et al. and later confirmed by Tseitlin and others. According to this rule, the biomass of marine pelagic organisms remains approximately equal in equal intervals of log-transformed body- size spanning the range from bacteria to whales. However, as noted by Tseitlin, long before the work of Sheldon et al. a similar pattern was discovered by M.S. Ghilarov for soil organisms. In his paper of 1944, Ghilarov unequivocally wrote: “The biomass of soil organisms of different natural body-size groups is approximately of the same order of magnitude: the product of the number of organisms belonging to a given size group times their linear size cubed varies very little.” Here, I show that Ghilarov’s “natural” body-size groups in the range from bacteria to myriapods and insects occupy approximately equal size intervals on a logarithmic scale. It turns out that equal logarithmic intervals of body-size contain approximately equal biomasses for both soil and pelagic organisms. The priority of the discovery of this rule belongs to Ghilarov. After Tseitlin, I propose to call it Ghilarov’s principle. Furthermore, I suggest that Ghilarov’s principle holds not only for soil and pelagic organisms but also for other organisms inhabiting sufficiently homogeneous and extended habitats.},

Movements of nutrients, detritus, prey, and consumers among habitats are ubiquitous in diverse biomes and can strongly influence population, consumer-resource, food web, and community dynamics. Nutrient and detrital subsidies usually increase primary and secondary productivity, both directly and indirectly. Prey subsidies, by movement of either prey or predators, usually enhance predator abundance beyond what local resources can support. Top-down effects occur when spatially subsidized consumers affect local resources by suppressing key resources and occasionally by initiating trophic cascades. Effects on community dynamics vary with the relative amount of input, the trophic roles of the mobile and recipient entities, and the local food web structure. Landscape variables such as the perimeter/area ratio of the focal habitat, permeability of habitat boundaries, and relative productivity of trophically connected habitats affect the degree and importance of spatial subsidization.},

	abstract = {Food webs in nature have multiple, reticulate connections between a diversity of consumers and resources. Such complexity affects web dynamics: it first spreads the direct effects of consumption and productivity throughout the web rather than focusing them at particular "trophic levels." Second, consumer densities are often donor controlled with food from across the trophic spectrum, the herbivore and detrital channels, other habitats, life-history omnivory, and even trophic mutualism. Although consumers usually do not affect these resources, increased numbers often allow consumers to depress other resources to levels lower than if donor-controlled resources were absent. We propose that such donor-controlled and "multichannel" omnivory is a general feature of consumer control and central to food web dynamics. This observation is contrary to the normal practice of inferring dynamics by simplifying webs into a few linear "trophic levels," as per "green world" theories. Such theories do not accommodate common and dynamically important features of real webs such as the ubiquity of donor control and the importance and dynamics of detritus, omnivory, resources crossing habitats, life history, nutrients (as opposed to energy), pathogens, resource defenses, and trophic symbioses. We conclude that trophic cascades and top-down community regulation as envisioned by trophic-level theories are relatively uncommon in nature.},

It is based on accepted relationships for the weight-dependence of metabolism and growth, in a context where individual organisms are assigned to one of a series of size classes for which the nominal weights increase in a geometric progression. Analysis of the biomass flow in such a representation leads to the conclusion that, in the steady state, the total biomass in any given size class decreases in a regular manner with increasing size. Explicitly, b(w{\textasciitilde})/b(wl){\textasciitilde}(w2/wl)-o.22, where b(we) and b(wl) are the total biomasses in the size classes characterised by weights w2 and Wl, respectively. The exponent (-0.22) represents a balance between catabolism and anabolism, based on published reviews concerning the revelant parameters. This result agrees favourably with data collected by other workers in the subtropical oceans. The theory can be used to draw conclusions about the functional dynamics of the pelagic ecosystem, such as community respiration and rate of biomass flow.},

Given the complexity of ecosystem processes, there is a need to evaluate the tools used to steer this thinking critically. ECOPATH with ECOSIM (EwE), an aggregate system-modelling package, is currently the most widely employed approach to assess the ecosystem effects of fishing. The basic equations and assumptions, strengths and weaknesses, and the potential of this approach to contribute to practical fisheries management advice are reviewed. Strengths include the structured parameterization framework, the inclusion of a well-balanced level of conceptual realism, a novel representation of predator-prey interaction terms, and the inclusion of a Bayes-like approach (ECORANGER) to take account of the uncertainty associated with values for model inputs. Weaknesses in model structure include the constraining nature of the mass-balance assumption (of ECOPATH) for initiating projections, the questionable handling of life history responses such as compensatory changes in the natural mortality rates of marine mammals, overcompensatory stock-recruit relationships that result from default parameter settings, possible problems in extrapolating from the microscale to the macroscale, as well as some (not too far-reaching) mathematical inconsistencies in the underlying equations. There is a paucity of systematic and stepwise investigations into model behaviour and properties, and users are cautioned against non-critical use of the default settings. An important limitation related to the predominant use of EwE as a “black-box” modelling tool is that some users fail to consider a range of alternative interaction representations. As with all multispecies approaches, the major limitation in applying the EwE approach lies in the quality and quantity of available data. Current EwE applications generally do not adequately address uncertainty in data inputs and model structure. Prudent EwE applications that utilize good data and are based upon rigorous statistical analyses can complement the quantitative predictions of traditional single-species models. They could be particularly useful in some contexts if output in the form of probability distributions encompassing a range of likely ecosystem responses were to be coupled with attempts to extend Operational Management Procedure (OMP) approaches to fisheries management beyond the singlespecies level. In particular, such applications could serve as the operating models of the underlying dynamics that are used for computer simulation testing of OMPs.},

To investigate how global environmental change will alter ﬁsh assemblages and productivity, we used a spatially explicit mechanistic model of the three main ﬁsh functional types reﬂected in ﬁsheries catches (FEISTY) coupled to an Earth system model (GFDL-ESM2M) to make projections out to 2100. We additionally explored the sensitivity of projections to uncertainties in widely used metabolic allometries and their temperature dependence. When integrated globally, the biomass and production of all types of ﬁsh decreased under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) compared to mean contemporary conditions. Projections also revealed strong increases in the ratio of pelagic zooplankton production to benthic production, a dominant driver of the abundance of large pelagic ﬁsh vs. demersal ﬁsh under historical conditions. Increases in this ratio led to a “pelagiﬁcation” of ecosystems exempliﬁed by shifts from benthic-based food webs toward pelagic-based ones. The resulting pelagic systems, however, were dominated by forage ﬁsh, as large pelagic ﬁsh suffered from increasing metabolic demands in a warming ocean and from declines in zooplankton productivity that were ampliﬁed at higher trophic levels. Patterns of relative change between functional types were robust to uncertainty in metabolic allometries and temperature dependence, though projections of the large pelagic ﬁsh had the greatest uncertainty. The same accumulation of trophic impacts that underlies the ampliﬁcation of productivity trends at higher trophic levels propagates to the projection spread, creating an acutely uncertain future for the ocean’s largest predatory ﬁsh.},

	abstract = {Understanding what structures ecological communities is vital to answering questions about extinctions, environmental change, trophic cascades, and ecosystem functioning. Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65\% of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction. The model results support the hypothesis that individual behavior, subject to natural selection, determines individual diets and that food web structure is the sum of these individual decisions.},

The results confirm the Norfolk Island group is used for foraging by resident adult and juvenile Chelonia mydas (Green) turtles and adult Eretmochelys imbricata (Hawksbill) turtles. The natal beaches for these resident animals are thought to be Melanesian and Polynesian islands to the north and the beaches of north eastern Australia. While juvenile hawksbill turtles have not been recorded foraging at Norfolk Island they are the most common species and age class recorded in the island’s strandings data.

	abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that species of smaller body size tend to be less vulnerable to contemporary extinction threats than larger species, but few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying this pattern. In this paper, data for the Australian terrestrial mammal fauna are used to ask whether higher reproductive output or smaller home ranges can explain the reduced extinction risk of smaller species. Extinct and endangered species do indeed have smaller litters and larger home ranges for their body size than expected under a null model. In multiple regressions, however, only litter size is a signiﬁcant predictor of extinction risk once body size and phylogeny are controlled for. Larger litters contribute to fast population growth, and are probably part of the reason that smaller species are less extinction-prone. The effect of litter size varies between the mesic coastal regions and the arid interior of Australia, indicating that the environment a species inhabits mediates the effect of biology on extinction risk. These results suggest that predicting extinction risk from biological traits is likely to be a complex task which must consider explicitly interactions between biology and environment.},

Trophic pyramids characterized by planktivore dominance emerged at high biomass, suggesting the importance of pelagic pathways for reef productivity. Total biomass and the biomass of most trophic groups were higher within gear restricted and no-take management, but the greatest biomass was found on unmanaged remote reefs. Within marine protected areas (MPAs), 41.6\% and 43.6\% of gear restricted and no-take zones, respectively, met a global biomass target of 500 kg/ha, compared with 71.8\% of remote sites. To improve conservation outcomes for Indonesia’s biodiverse and economically important coral reef fisheries, our results suggest to: (1) strengthen management within Indonesia’s existing MPAs and (2) precautionarily manage remote reefs with high biomass.},

The frequency distribution of body masses among species for the entire continental fauna was highly modal and right skewed, even on a logarithmic scale; the median size of the 465 species was approximately 45 g. In contrast, comparable frequency distributions for 24 small patches of relatively homogeneous habitat were essentially uniform, with approximately equal numbers of species in each logarithmic size class; the median sizes of the 19-37 species ranged from approximately 100 to 2,500 g. Frequency distributions for 21 biomes (large regions of relatively similar vegetation) were intermediate between the continental and local assemblages. This pattern of assembly indicates that species of modal size (20-250 g) tend not to coexist in local habitat patches and they replace each other more frequently from habitat to habitat across the landscape than species of relatively large or small size. We hypothesize that three mechanisms are necessary and possibly sufficient to produce this result: competitive exclusion of species of similar size within local habitats, differential extinction of species of large size with small geographic ranges, and greater specialization of modal-sized species owing to energetic and dietary constraints.},

Many ‘historical’ and ‘ecological’ hypotheses have been proposed and debated, but there is still little consensus. Recent discussions have centred around two main phenomena: phylogenetic niche conservatism and ecological productivity. These two factors play important roles, but accumulating theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the single most important factor is kinetics: the temperature dependence of ecological and evolutionary rates. The relatively high temperatures in the tropics generate and maintain high diversity because ‘the Red Queen runs faster when she is hot’.},

In most cases bleaching has been attributed to elevated temperature, but other instances involving high solar irradiance, and sometimes disease, have also been documented. It is timely, in view of our concern about worldwide reef condition, to review knowledge of physical and biological factors involved in bleaching, the mechanisms of zooxanthellae and pigment loss, and the ecological consequences for coral communities. Here we evaluate recently acquired data on temperature and irradiance-induced bleaching, including long-term data sets which suggest that repeated bleaching events may be the consequence of a steadily rising background sea temperature that will in the future expose corals to an increasingly hostile environment. Cellular mechanisms of bleaching involve a variety of processes that include the degeneration of zooxanthellae in situ, release of zooxanthellae from mesenterial ﬁlaments and release of algae within host cells which become detached from the endoderm. Photo-protective defences (particularly carotenoid pigments) in zooxanthellae are likely to play an important role in limiting the bleaching response which is probably elicited by a combination of elevated temperature and irradiance in the ﬁeld. The ability of corals to respond adaptively to recurrent bleaching episodes is not known, but preliminary evidence suggests that phenotypic responses of both corals and zooxanthellae may be signiﬁcant.},

	abstract = {Understanding the consequences of species loss in complex ecological communities is one of the great challenges in current biodiversity research. For a long time, this topic has been addressed by traditional biodiversity experiments. Most of these approaches treat species as trait-free, taxonomic units characterizing communities only by species number without accounting for species traits. However, extinctions do not occur at random as there is a clear correlation between extinction risk and species traits. In this review, we assume that large species will be most threatened by extinction and use novel allometric and size-spectrum concepts that include body mass as a primary species trait at the levels of populations and individuals, respectively, to re-assess three classic debates on the relationships between biodiversity and (i) food-web structural complexity, (ii) community dynamic stability, and (iii) ecosystem functioning. Contrasting current expectations, size-structured approaches suggest that the loss of large species, that typically exploit most resource species, may lead to future food webs that are less interwoven and more structured by chains of interactions and compartments. The disruption of natural body-mass distributions maintaining food-web stability may trigger avalanches of secondary extinctions and strong trophic cascades with expected knock-on effects on the functionality of the ecosystems. Therefore, we argue that it is crucial to take into account body size as a species trait when analysing the consequences of biodiversity loss for natural ecosystems. Applying size-structured approaches provides an integrative ecological concept that enables a better understanding of each species’ unique role across communities and the causes and consequences of biodiversity loss.},

Recognized as potent ecosystem engineers due to their intense grazing of macroalgae and sea grass and highly valued for their gonads, wild populations of Tripneustes are commercially exploited for fisheries and aquaculture. Recently, a new species, Tripneustes kermadecensis (Bronstein et al. 2017), was described from the southern Pacific Ocean, off the Kermadec Islands, near the tropical/sub-tropical transition zone. Here, we explore the range of Tripneustes and, in particular, T. kermadecensis by morphological and genetic tools to determine whether it also occurs in Australia. We report, for the first time, the presence of a second Tripneustes species, T. kermadecensis, from Australia. We show that T. kermadecensis is in fact highly abundant throughout most of sub-tropical eastern Australia, where it occurs in association with coral and temperate reefs and has been recognized for decades as the ‘lamington sea urchin’. As commercial exploitation and stockrelease programs of Tripneustes are rapidly expanding, and as global warming causes tropicalization of eastern Australia, driving the southern expansion of its congener T. gratilla, we call for re-evaluation of the conservation vulnerability of T. kermadecensis along the Australian continent and action by the aquaculture industry to genetically confirm the species identity of stocks in their facilities.},

              Future climate impacts and their consequences are increasingly being explored using multi-model ensembles that average across individual model projections.

              century in relation to socioeconomic indicators at national to global scales. Significant biomass changes are projected in 40\%–57\% of the global ocean, with 68\%–84\% of these areas exhibiting declining trends under low and high emission scenarios, respectively. Given unabated emissions, maritime nations with poor socioeconomic statuses such as low nutrition, wealth, and ocean health will experience the greatest projected losses. These findings suggest that climate-driven biomass changes will widen existing equity gaps and disproportionally affect populations that contributed least to global CO

Despite clear differences in the taxonomic composition among sites, the shape of the size distribution was remarkably similar in all sites. Substrate composition affected the overall abundance of invertebrates more than their size distribution. Overall density peaked on fine and coarse gravel and was lower on sand and boulders. Total abundance of invertebrates was highest in eutrophic sites ([TP] {\textgreater} 40 ,g/L), although only organisms larger than 1 mm (approximately 1 ,ug dry mass) showed higher abundances in richer sites. The increase in total invertebrate abundance with increasing total phosphorus concentration suggests that these streams are phosphorus limited. Animals smaller than 1 mm long account for less than 3\% of the respiration of the benthic assemblage on all substrates in our streams. Size distribution of invertebrates, although affected by substrate composition and trophy, is remarkably constant and predictable in our streams. Most of the biomass, and consequently the consumption, respiration, and secondary production, is found in relatively large invertebrates. Meiofauna is relatively rare and consequently has little direct influence on community metabolism in the streams we studied.},

We develop a standardized presentation for several example environments where detailed data on biomass density by body size in the trophic positions, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, and fish, make it possible to establish overall or primary spectral slopes. The basic methodology is adapted for application to other ecosystems where less detailed data are available. Spectra from all the different environments exhibit a uniform low slope, but with different intercepts that appear to reflect ecosystem differences in nutrient circulation and availability. Detail on the secondary structuring at various positions in the trophic system appears to provide information useful for distinguishing between long-term changes in productivity and short-term perturbations in biomass or abundance.},

	abstract = {The eastern Bering Sea (EBS) is a highly productive subarctic marine ecosystem that is exposed to considerable climate variability and is noted for conservative management of its ﬁshery resources. The community size spectrum (CSS; relationship between animal abundance and size) of ﬁsh captured in EBS shelf bottom trawl surveys was examined for evidence of change over time and ﬁshing and climate effects. The slope (indicative of ﬁsh size) and height (indicative of ecosystem productivity, or essentially ﬁsh abundance) of the CSS can change due to changes in ﬁshing intensity and climate variability. Linear trends were not observed in EBS groundﬁsh size or abundance during 1982–2006. The abundance of large-sized ﬁsh increased in 2001–2006 relative to 1982–2000. Observed changes in CSS height partially corroborated evidence for decreased productivity of the main ﬁshery target species since the late 1990s, which may have been due to changes in relative species composition. In addition, abundance and size composition of nontarget ﬁsh decreased during 1982–2006, possibly related to changes in water temperature. In contrast, however, the size and productivity of ﬁsh that were primarily bycatch species increased during 1982–2006. Unlike in other ecosystems, changes in CSS slopes and heights for the EBS were not related to exploitation rates. Changes in the abundance of ﬁsh in areas that were normally occupied by cold bottom water (northwest inner and middle shelf) may have been related to the effects of temperature on ﬁsh distribution.},

Latitudinal richness is underpinned by scale-independent patterns of total and relative abundances, suggesting ecological constraints scale up to determine abundances within communities. In contrast, the longitudinal gradient of species richness typically attributed to historical biogeography only emerges at the largest scale and is accompanied by a similar pattern of relative abundances, suggesting that site-to-site compositional variation leading to species aggregation (i.e. a component of β-diversity) underlies this gradient. Examining relationships among the components that underpin biodiversity gradients reveals new patterns that can better identify processes influencing patterns of biodiversity.},

            Ecosystem-based management requires the development of indicators that allow anthropogenic impacts to be detected against the background of natural variation. Size-based community metrics are potentially useful indicators because of their theoretical foundation and practical utility. Temporal and spatial patterns in size-based community metrics for Celtic Sea fish are described and calculated using data from the English groundfish survey of the area (1987–2003). The results reveal that the size structure of the community has changed over time, and that a decrease in the relative abundance of larger fish was accompanied by an increase in smaller fish (4–25 g). Temporal analyses of the effects of fishing and climate variation suggest that fishing generally has had a stronger effect on size structure than changes in temperature. Therefore, size-based metrics respond clearly to the effects of fishing even in variable environments, reflecting the ubiquity of size-based processes in defining community structure and responses to mortality. Spatial analyses were inconclusive, probably owing to the limited area for which fishing effort, temperature, and survey data were all available.},

	abstract = {The Providence Petrel (Pterodroma solandri) currently breeds only on Lord Howe and Phillip Islands and is globally threatened. It once bred on Norfolk Island in large numbers but was extirpated by the late 18th century, greatly reducing the inﬂux of marine-derived nutrients in the form of droppings, and failed eggs and chicks. This lack of nutrients has impaired the health of the remaining native forests on Norfolk Island. The re-establishment of a colony of Providence Petrels on Norfolk Island would not only provide another viable breeding colony of this threatened species but is essential to restore ecosystem function on Norfolk Island. This paper investigates the biology of Providence Petrel chicks as a prerequisite for the translocation of this species to Norfolk Island from Lord Howe. Petrels are highly philopatric, so only chicks not yet imprinted at their natal colony can be translocated. We investigated the timing of ﬁrst emergence from the burrow, growth and provisioning of chicks on Lord Howe Island, and developed selection and ageing criteria for translocation, together with appropriate feeding regimes. Such information is critical for the success of the proposed translocation.},

Under these assumptions, it is shown that linear size spectra are stationary solutions of the model.

Despite this, public and political awareness of the scale and significance of this marine ecosystem is low, and research investment miniscule (,10\%), relative to comparable ecosystems. The absence of an identity for Australia’s temperate reefs as an entity has probably contributed to the current lack of appreciation of this system, which is at odds with its profound ecological, social and economic importance. We define the ‘Great Southern Reef’ (GSR) as Australia’s spatially connected temperate reef system. The GSR covers ,71 000 km2 and represents a global biodiversity hotspot across at least nine phyla. GSR-related fishing and tourism generates at least AU\$10 billion yearÀ1, and in this context the GSR is a significant natural asset for Australia and globally. Maintaining the health and ecological functioning of the GSR is critical to the continued sustainability of human livelihoods and wellbeing derived from it. By recognising the GSR as an entity we seek to boost awareness, and take steps towards negotiating the difficult challenges the GSR faces in a future of unprecedented coastal population growth and global change.},

Traditional hypotheses that account for such exceptional biodiversity have highlighted the importance of environmental variables such as habitat area and energy input. Recently, however, an additional explanation has been proposed based on geometric constraints in the placement of geographical ranges within a bounded domain, which cause a mid-domain peak in species richness; the mid-domain effect (MDE). Here, for the ﬁrst time, we examine the relative importance of area, energy and MDE jointly on species richness patterns. Model selection indicates that the best model incorporates MDE and reef area, but no energy effect; moreover, this best-ﬁt model captures all major features of reef ﬁsh and coral species richness patterns. Habitat area is the major environmental factor inﬂuencing species richness. The prevention of further fragmentation and loss of habitat area is of critical importance for the conservation of coral reef biodiversity.},

Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justiﬁed by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for conﬁrmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

Here we use the metabolic theory of ecology as a framework to formulate and test a model that yields predictions linking population density to the physiological constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolism, and the ecological constraints of trophic structure and species richness on energy partitioning among species. Our model was tested by applying Bayesian quantile regression to a comprehensive reef-fish community database, from which we extracted density data for 5609 populations spread across 49 sites around the world. Our results indicate that population density declines markedly with increases in community species richness and that, after accounting for richness, energetic constraints are manifested most strongly for the most abundant species, which generally are of small body size and occupy lower trophic groups. Overall, our findings suggest that, at the global scale, factors associated with community species richness are the major drivers of variation in population density. Given that populations of species-rich tropical systems exhibit markedly lower maximum densities, they may be particularly susceptible to stochastic extinction.},

            Understanding the origin and evolution of the shapes observed in nature remains an exciting challenge. Even from a cursory inspection, it is clear that the shapes of animals and plants, as determined by the distribution of mass over volume, are distinct. Animals are able to move and are approximately homogeneous in their mass distribution. Plants are rooted organisms endowed with heterogeneous self-similar geometry where the mass is concentrated in the stem and branches rather than in the leaves. By addressing the fundamental physics underlying the relation between form and physiology and the origins of Kleiber’s law, we discuss how the two divergent life forms of plants and animals may have independently evolved to achieve equivalent energetic efficiencies.
          , 
            Despite the vast diversity of sizes and shapes of living organisms, life’s organization across scales exhibits remarkable commonalities, most notably through the approximate validity of Kleiber’s law, the power law scaling of metabolic rates with the mass of an organism. Here, we present a derivation of Kleiber’s law that is independent of the specificity of the myriads of organism species. Specifically, we account for the distinct geometries of trees and mammals as well as deviations from the pure power law behavior of Kleiber’s law, and predict the possibility of life forms with geometries intermediate between trees and mammals. We also make several predictions in excellent accord with empirical data. Our theory relates the separate evolutionary histories of plants and animals through the fundamental physics underlying their distinct overall forms and physiologies.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs have been heavily affected by elevated sea-surface temperature (SST) and coral bleaching since the late 1980s; however, until recently coastal reefs of north-western Australia have been relatively unaffected compared to Timor Sea and eastern Australian reefs. We compare SST time series with changes in coral cover spanning a period of up to 36 years to describe temporal and spatial variability in bleaching and associated coral mortality throughout the Pilbara–Ningaloo region. Declines in coral cover ranged from 12.5 to 51.3\%, with relative declines ranging from 38 to 92\%. Since 2013, coral cover throughout the region has declined to historically low levels at four of five subregions, with impaired recovery occurring at two subregions. Observations are consistent with global trends of repeated severe heat waves, coral bleaching and acute declines in coral cover. Locations within this study region have already experienced multiple coralbleaching events within a period of less than 5 years. There is a high likelihood that reefs in the western Pilbara and northern Ningaloo regions will experience more frequent marine heatwaves, coral bleaching and mortality events in the future. Action, therefore, needs to be taken now to support the resilience of coral reef ecosystems in the region, which is arguably the most important coral-reef province on Australia’s western coast.},

The presence of two spatially distinct outfalls discharging untreated wastewaters allowed to use a balanced symmetrical after control/ impact (ACI) design that consisted of two putatively impacted locations and two controls, with four sites nested in each location. Surveys were performed in 2006 at two random dates. The study highlighted signiﬁcant changes at both assemblage and individual species levels. Fish assemblages structures were different between controls and sewages, where total abundance of ﬁsh were higher. The responses of individual species to sewage pollution were mostly related to an anomalous increase of two small opportunistic species i.e. Gobius bucchichii and Parablennius rouxi and to a decrease of species of the genus Symphodus, particularly S. roissali and S. ocellatus. Moreover in correspondence of the outfalls, signiﬁcant changes of the ﬁsh size distribution were detected for several species. These results support the use of ﬁsh assemblages as biological indicators for marine coastal waters and demonstrated the possibility to obtain sharp signals of environmental impact from some individual ﬁsh species.},

Sediments were found to be randomly distributed, making up a mosaic of silty and sandy sites. On the contrary, the estimated spatial variability of macrofauna within all the scales up to 5500 m depended upon neither extent (total area covered) nor grain (®nest spatial resolution) but only their ratio. We treat this as evidence of statistical self-similarity (fractal property) of the pattern. For diatoms, spatial heterogeneity of community structure was also self-similar in the range from 0.25 to 75 m (within a single bight). At larger scales, microalgae showed a combination of patchy structure with pronounced gradient along the shoreline from brackish-water to marine ¯ora. Thus, fractal properties of both groups became manifested at scales corresponding to their mean body size. The ranges of fractal patterns were approximately equal to 103±105 if measured in body size units. We suggest that fractal-like spatial structures may be a general feature of communities, and speculate on the nature of such patterns.},

Nowadays it is not a full-blown theory but rather a flexible and progressively developing methodology to outline future unifying theories. It provides a powerful conceptual framework for generating testable hypotheses and studying a wide range of ecological phenomena related with such themes as heterogeneity, hierarchy and size. Spatio-temporal heterogeneity, organizational hierarchies and body size are the main scaling factors for ecological patterns and processes. Broad comparison of patterns for these three different but interrelated dimensions can reveal some new regularities ("scaling laws") of ecological systems. It also allows us to look at the worlds of different organisms "through their own eyes". Some examples of applying the cross-scaling approach in marine ecology are considered: \&amp;\#151; Patterns and scales of spatial heterogeneity; \&amp;\#151; Species-area curves and body size; \&amp;\#151; Co-occurrence of congeners as scale-dependent phenomenon; \&amp;\#151; Spatio-temporal ranges of ecological hierarchies.},

Data deﬁciencies, however, currently hamper analysis of global ﬁshing effort. We analyzed data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the EUROPA ﬁshing ﬂeet registry, and peer-reviewed and other publications, to determine the global trends in ﬁshing effort from 1950 to 2006. Our results show that global ﬁshing effort, expressed as total engine power and the number of ﬁshing days in a year (kilowatt days), was roughly constant from 1950 to 1970, and then steadily increased up to the present. Europe dominated global ﬁshing effort, followed by Asia. Projecting current trends suggests that Asia will soon surpass Europe. Trawlers contribute a major fraction of global ﬁshing effort, as do vessels greater than 100 gross registered tons. Current estimates of global ﬁshing effort, the number of vessels, and total vessel tonnage are, however, underestimates given the data gaps that we have identiﬁed. Our results are useful in the following ways: (1) they may encourage researchers in academia and government to improve global ﬁshing effort databases; (2) they allow deeper global analyses of the impact of ﬁshing on marine ecosystems; (3) they induce caution in accepting current underestimates of economic losses of global ﬁsheries; and (4) they reinforce calls for a reduction in global ﬁshing effort.},

	abstract = {Much of the Baltic Sea is currently classiﬁed as ‘affected by eutrophication’. The causes for this are twofold. First, current levels of nutrient inputs (nitrogen and phosphorus) from human activities exceed the natural processing capacity with an accumulation of nutrients in the Baltic Sea over the last 50–100 years. Secondly, the Baltic Sea is naturally susceptible to nutrient enrichment due to a combination of long retention times and stratiﬁcation restricting ventilation of deep waters. Here, based on a unique data set collated from research activities and long-term monitoring programs, we report on the temporal and spatial trends of eutrophication status for the open Baltic Sea over a 112-year period using the HELCOM Eutrophication Assessment Tool (HEAT 3.0). Further, we analyse variation in the conﬁdence of the eutrophication status assessment based on a systematic quantitative approach using coefﬁcients of variation in the observations. The classiﬁcations in our assessment indicate that the ﬁrst signs of eutrophication emerged in the mid-1950s and the central parts of the Baltic Sea changed from being unaffected by eutrophication to being affected. We document improvements in eutrophication status that are direct consequences of long-term efforts to reduce the inputs of nutrients. The reductions in both nitrogen and phosphorus loads have led to large-scale alleviation of eutrophication and to a healthier Baltic Sea. Reduced conﬁdence in our assessment is seen more recently due to reductions in the scope of monitoring programs. Our study sets a baseline for implementation of the ecosystem-based management strategies and policies currently in place including the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directives and the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan.},

Within the general framework, three model types have emerged that differ in their degree of complexity: the food-web, the trait-based, and the community models. We demonstrate the differences between the models through examples of their response to ﬁshing and their dynamic behavior. We review implementations of size spectrum models and describe important variations concerning the functional response, whether growth is food-dependent or ﬁxed, and the density dependence imposed on the system.

	abstract = {Coral community shifts towards reefs dominated by stress-resistant corals have contributed to rapid declines in the architectural complexity of reefs throughout the Caribbean. Complex reef architecture provides important niches and refuges for many reef fishes and thus widespread declines in reef complexity could have important consequences for the structure and function of fish assemblages. We explore the influence of reef architecture on fish assemblages by comparing the size and trophic structure of reef fishes along a 20 km-long 15-reef gradient of coral cover, coral species dominance and architectural complexity in Cozumel, Mexico. Our results show that reefs with high architectural complexity, in particular those dominated by robust Montastraea corals, supported fish assemblages with larger numbers of individuals in the smallest size classes (,20 cm) and longer food chains (higher mean trophic levels). The association between coral complexity and fish communities is highly size-structured and is greatest for smallest size classes. The greater abundance of both small fish and the key early life stages of larger fishes on more complex reefs suggests that architectural complexity may influence entire reef fish assemblages, even though larger fish are less dependent on reef complexity. Key reef-building corals such as Montastraea are thus likely to be disproportionately important for maintaining reef fish communities, and shifts in Caribbean coral communities may compromise fish recruitment and truncate food chains, reducing resilience and inhibiting reef recovery from degradation.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are rich in biodiversity, in large part because their highly complex architecture provides shelter and resources for a wide range of organisms. Recent rapid declines in hard coral cover have occurred across the Caribbean region, but the concomitant consequences for reef architecture have not been quantified on a large scale to date. We provide, to our knowledge, the first region-wide analysis of changes in reef architectural complexity, using nearly 500 surveys across 200 reefs, between 1969 and 2008. The architectural complexity of Caribbean reefs has declined nonlinearly with the near disappearance of the most complex reefs over the last 40 years. The flattening of Caribbean reefs was apparent by the early 1980s, followed by a period of stasis between 1985 and 1998 and then a resumption of the decline in complexity to the present. Rates of loss are similar on shallow ({\textless}6 m), mid-water (6–20 m) and deep ({\textgreater}20 m) reefs and are consistent across all five subregions. The temporal pattern of declining architecture coincides with key events in recent Caribbean ecological history: the loss of structurally complex
              Acropora
              corals, the mass mortality of the grazing urchin
              Diadema antillarum
              and the 1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation-induced worldwide coral bleaching event. The consistently low estimates of current architectural complexity suggest regional-scale degradation and homogenization of reef structure. The widespread loss of architectural complexity is likely to have serious consequences for reef biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and associated environmental services.},

	abstract = {Neutral biodiversity theory has the potential to contribute to our understanding of how macroevolutionary dynamics inﬂuence contemporary biodiversity, but there are issues regarding its dynamical predictions that must ﬁrst be resolved. Here we address these issues by extending the theory in two ways using a novel analytical approach: (1) we set the absolute tempo of biodiversity dynamics by explicitly incorporating population-level stochasticity in abundance; (2) we allow new species to arise with more than one individual. Setting the absolute tempo yields quantitative predictions on biodiversity dynamics that can be tested using contemporary and fossil data. Allowing incipientspecies abundances greater than one individual yields predictions on how these dynamics, and the form of the species-abundance distribution, are affected by multiple speciation modes. We apply this new model to contemporary and fossil data that encompass 30 Myr of macroevolution for planktonic foraminifera. By synthesizing the model with these empirical data, we present evidence that dynamical issues with neutral biodiversity theory may be resolved by incorporating the effects of environmental stochasticity and incipient-species abundance on biodiversity dynamics.},

	abstract = {A series of mathematical models of cohorts in animal populations representing various combinations of several different simple growth and mortality functions is examined to investigate the ratio between mean biomass and production over unit time, and to compare this ratio with the mean age and mean life span of the animals in the cohort.For any cohort, the ratio of production per unit time to mean biomass is equal to the ratio of total production by the cohort to its total biomass integral by time. For populations consisting of a number of simultaneous, successive, or overlapping cohorts, the ratio of production per unit time to mean biomass is equal to the mean of the ratios for the individual cohorts weighted by the mean biomasses of the cohorts.If the cohorts are identical, the population ratio is the same as the cohort ratio and problems arising from the presence of more than one cohort may be ignored. Formulations for the total production per cohort, biomass integral, and, where they can be simplified, their ratios, are given.Comparison with mean age and mean life span shows that for constant exponential mortality, mean age and mean life span are both equal to the reciprocal of the production–biomass ratio. For other mortality functions, if growth in weight is linear, the production–biomass ratio equals the reciprocal of the mean age. For other models there is no simple relation. In general, mean age appears a better approximation than mean life span to the reciprocal of the production–biomass ratio.These methods are applied, as an example, to Antarctic krill, using a model having linear growth in length and four periods with different exponential mortality rates. For this model, annual production is 1.8 times the mean biomass so that assumption of equality leads to an underestimate of production. Mean age and mean life span are 0.21 and 0.037 years respectively. Thus, use of either of these as an approximation, and particularly mean life span, leads to severe overestimation of annual production.},

	abstract = {We used stomach contents and stable isotope ratios of ﬁshes and macroinvertebrates, collected bi-monthly over 18 months from Mad Island Marsh, a small tidal estuary on the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coast, to examine potential body size–trophic position relationships. Mean body size (length) of predator taxa yielding measurable prey items were signiﬁcantly correlated with body size (length) of their prey and mean volume of their stomach contents, however, the strength of the correlation was greater when two larger detrivores (i.e., striped mullet and gizzard shad) were excluded from the analysis. Similarly, trophic positions estimated by volumetric stomach contents were also signiﬁcantly related to predator body size but not related to mean volume of stomach contents, but again excluding those detrivores from the analyses increased the strength of the relationship. Trophic positions estimated from stable isotopes and d15N as an index of trophic position were also unrelated to predator body length, but signiﬁcantly related to predator body mass. Although estimates of trophic positions in this tidal estuary using both methods were largely concordant, there were some exceptional zooplanktivorous and detritivorous species that had higher trophic levels according to nitrogen isotope ratios. Excluding those species from the analyses increased the strength of relationships between size and trophic positions of predators. A signiﬁcant relationship between body sizes of consumers and their prey supports the view that body size is a key variable inﬂuencing trophic interactions and the structure of aquatic food webs. Our results also suggest that body size (especially consumer mass) is a good predictor of trophic levels estimated by stable isotopes, whereas consumer length is an important trait predicting the trophic level estimated from stomach contents in this tidal estuarine system.},

We therefore examined this relationship in a coral reef fish assemblage, focusing on individuals. Using a comprehensive data set, with over 14,000 observations we found that the relationship between local density and adult body size differs from the linear relationship predicted by the ‘energetic equivalence rule’. However, excluding the smallest size classes, the relationship between body size and individual abundance for intermediate to larger fish did not depart from the predicted −0.75. Unlike plants and intermediate to large reef fishes, the smallest fishes appear to have constraints that may reflect different patterns of resource acquisition.},

We found a negative linear relationship between density and adult body size. This is in marked contrast to the polygonal relationship previously described for other local scale assemblage studies. Our linear relationship may be a consequence of the larger differences in body size among taxa.

Small 3.5 m2 quantitative rotenone samples, using a fine-mesh net to enclose the site, were compared with visual-point censuses (prior to the placement of the net), random-point censuses and strip censuses. Furthermore, the fishes collected inside and outside the net were examined to determine the relative efficiency of enclosed versus open rotenone samples. Rotenone samples comprised 128 species in 28 families. Of these, only 49\% of the species overlapped between the enclosed (inside net) and open (outside net) samples. Only 17.7\% of the species in the enclosed rotenone sample were seen prior to collection. Rotenone samples reveal that visual censuses underestimated the abundance of small taxa. Overall, rotenone samples increased the estimated number of species by 40.4\% and the total fish abundance by 50.1\% (75.3\% for fishes {\textless} 50 mm). Biomass increased by less than 1.0\%. However, through relatively high energetic demands, high turnover rates and their role as potential prey, small fish taxa may play a greater role in reef processes than previously assumed. The limits of visual censusing techniques are highlighted, emphasising the value of small, enclosed, intensive rotenone samples for providing reliable quantitative samples of small taxa.},

Synthesis of the literature shows that: (1) recent studies, in general, agree that precipitation and streamflow extremes should be described by heavy-tailed distributions, (2) the Method of Moments (MOM) is typically the first choice in esti­ mating distribution parameters but it is outperformed by methods such as L-Moments (LM), Maximum Likeli­ hood (ML), Least Squares (LS), and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC), (3) there are less popular parameter estimation techniques such as the Maximum Product of Spacings (MPS), the Elemental Percentile (EP), and the Minimum Density Power Divergence Estimator (MDPDE) that have shown competitive perfor­ mance in fitting extreme value distributions, and (4) non-stationary analyses of extreme events are gaining popularity; the ML is the typically used method, yet literature suggests that the Generalized Maximum Likelihood (GML) and the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) may be better alternatives. The review offers a synthesis of past and contemporary methods used in the analysis of hydroclimatic extremes, aiming to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

            Size structure of fish stock plays an important role in maintaining sustainability of the population. Size distribution of an exploited stock is predicted to shift toward small individuals caused by size-selective fishing and/or warming; however, their relative contribution remains relatively unexplored. In addition, existing analyses on size structure have focused on univariate size-based indicators (SBIs), such as mean length, evenness of size classes, or the upper 95-percentile of the length frequency distribution; these approaches may not capture full information of size structure. To bridge the gap, we used the variation partitioning approach to examine how the size structure (composition of size classes) responded to fishing, warming and the interaction. We analyzed 28 exploited stocks in the West US, Alaska and North Sea. Our result shows fishing has the most prominent effect on the size structure of the exploited stocks. In addition, the fish stocks experienced higher variability in fishing is more responsive to the temperature effect in their size structure, suggesting that fishing may elevate the sensitivity of exploited stocks in responding to environmental effects. The variation partitioning approach provides complementary information to univariate SBIs in analyzing size structure.},

Body size, an integrative trait that determines demographic rates and ecosystem functions, is thought to be shrinking in the Anthropocene. Here, we assessed the prevalence of body size change in six taxon groups across 5025 assemblage time series spanning 1960 to 2020. Using the Price equation to partition this change into within-species body size versus compositional changes, we detected prevailing decreases in body size through time driven primarily by fish, with more variable patterns in other taxa. We found that change in assemblage composition contributes more to body size changes than within-species trends, but both components show substantial variation in magnitude and direction. The biomass of assemblages remains quite stable as decreases in body size trade off with increases in abundance.

              et al
              . analyzed body-size trends in plant and animal communities since 1960 from the BioTIME database and separated the effects of changes within species from those driven by species composition. They found that trends varied across communities, with marine fish more consistently shifted toward smaller body size. Mean body size changed within populations, but community-level trends were more affected by changes in the abundance of small- and large-bodied species. Biomass generally stayed stable over time, suggesting that more small individuals were present despite the loss of larger ones. —Bianca Lopez

Meta-analyses reveal ﬁndings are biased towards studies in shallower depths suitable for diving surveys. Empirical comparisons in deeper waters, including among areas with diﬀering spatial management, further contribute to understanding of MPA beneﬁts and constraints. We compare length and abundance of commercially and recreationally targeted ﬁshes (and bycatch) among management types within and adjacent to the Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP), Australia. Sampling was done on reefs between 25 and 40 m depth in ‘no-take’ and ﬁshed ‘partially protected’ areas within the marine park and ﬁshed areas outside the SIMP, using stereo- Baited Remote Underwater Videos (stereo-BRUVs) at eight, nine, thirteen and fourteen years after these ‘no take’ areas were established. Four species targeted by ﬁshers: snapper Chrysophrys auratus, grey morwong Nemadactylus douglasi, pearl perch Glaucosoma scapulare, and venus-tuskﬁsh Choerodon venustus, were more abundant and larger in ‘no take’ zones overall and showed an increase through time in ‘no take’ relative to both types of ﬁshed area. In contrast, there was no distinct pattern of four bycatch species increasing in abundance in ‘no-take’ areas. Abundances of ﬁsh in partially protected areas were similar to ﬁshed areas outside the MPA. This study adds empirical evidence to the assertion that ‘no take’ areas in particular, can contribute to both marine conservation and natural resource management.},

	abstract = {Animal body-size variation influences multiple processes in marine ecosystems, but habitat heterogeneity has prevented a comprehensive assessment of size across pelagic (midwater) and benthic (seabed) systems along anthropic gradients. In this work, we derive fish size indicators from 17,411 stereo baited-video deployments to test for differences between pelagic and benthic responses to remoteness from human pressures and effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs). From records of 823,849 individual fish, we report divergent responses between systems, with pelagic size structure more profoundly eroded near human markets than benthic size structure, signifying greater vulnerability of pelagic systems to human pressure. Effective protection of benthic size structure can be achieved through MPAs placed near markets, thereby contributing to benthic habitat restoration and the recovery of associated fishes. By contrast, recovery of the world’s largest and most endangered fishes in pelagic systems requires the creation of highly protected areas in remote locations, including on the High Seas, where protection efforts lag.

            Editor’s summary
            
              Marine megafauna are increasingly threatened and are difficult to protect. Understanding the influence of humans on body size in fishes is also challenging given that data on marine species often come from fishery-based activities. Letessier
              et al
              . deployed more than 17,000 remotely operated baited devices to collect data on fish size and abundance as related to habitat (pelagic or benthic), human activities, and marine protected areas. Pelagic species were strongly influenced by human pressures and protection. The authors concluded that benthic species could be effectively protected even near markets, whereas only more remote protected areas will effectively safeguard large pelagic species. —Sacha Vignieri

Here, we conduct a global-scale study of how four key metrics of ecosystem states and processes on coral reefs (top predator presence, reef ﬁsh biomass, trait diversity, and parrotﬁsh scraping potential) are explained by 11 indicators based on key human-environment theories from the social sciences. Our global analysis of {\textgreater}1,500 reefs reveals three key ﬁndings. First, the proximity of the nearest market has the strongest and most consistent relationships with these ecosystem metrics. This ﬁnding is in keeping with a body of terrestrial research on how market accessibility shapes agricultural practices, but the integration of these concepts in marine systems is nascent. Second, our global study shows that resource conditions tend to display a n-shaped relationship with socioeconomic development. Specifically, the probabilities of encountering a top predator, ﬁsh biomass, and ﬁsh trait diversity were highest where human development was moderate but lower where development was either high or low. This ﬁnding contrasts with previous regional-scale research demonstrating an environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis (which predicts a U-shaped relationship between socioeconomic development and resource conditions). Third, together, our ecosystem metrics are best explained by the integration of different human-environment theories. Our best model includes the interactions between indicators from different theoretical perspectives, revealing how marine reserves can have different outcomes depending on how far they are from markets and human settlements, as well as the size of the surrounding human population.},

            Marine fisheries in coastal ecosystems in many areas of the world have historically removed large‐bodied individuals, potentially impairing ecosystem functioning and the long‐term sustainability of fish populations. Reporting on size‐based indicators that link to food‐web structure can contribute to ecosystem‐based management, but the application of these indicators over large (cross‐ecosystem) geographical scales has been limited to either fisheries‐dependent catch data or diver‐based methods restricted to shallow waters ({\textless}20 m) that can misrepresent the abundance of large‐bodied fished species. We obtained data on the body‐size structure of 82 recreationally or commercially targeted marine demersal teleosts from 2904 deployments of baited remote underwater stereo‐video (stereo‐BRUV). Sampling was at up to 50 m depth and covered approximately 10,000 km of the continental shelf of Australia. Seascape relief, water depth, and human gravity (i.e., a proxy of human impacts) were the strongest predictors of the probability of occurrence of large fishes and the abundance of fishes above the minimum legal size of capture. No‐take marine reserves had a positive effect on the abundance of fishes above legal size, although the effect varied across species groups. In contrast, sublegal fishes were best predicted by gradients in sea surface temperature (mean and variance). In areas of low human impact, large fishes were about three times more likely to be encountered and fishes of legal size were approximately five times more abundant. For conspicuous species groups with contrasting habitat, environmental, and biogeographic affinities, abundance of legal‐size fishes typically declined as human impact increased. Our large‐scale quantitative analyses highlight the combined importance of seascape complexity, regions with low human footprint, and no‐take marine reserves in protecting large‐bodied fishes across a broad range of species and ecosystem configurations.

            Resumen
            Las pesquerías marinas de los ecosistemas costeros en muchas áreas del mundo históricamente han removido a individuos de gran tamaño, potencialmente perjudicando el funcionamiento ambiental y la sostenibilidad a largo plazo de las poblaciones de peces. Los reportes sobre los indicadores basados en el tamaño que se vinculan con la estructura de la red alimenticia pueden contribuir al manejo basado en el ecosistema, aunque la aplicación de estos indicadores a grandes (inter‐ecosistemas) escalas geográficas ha estado limitada a datos de captura dependientes de las pesquerías o métodos basados en el buceo restringidos a aguas someras ({\textless}20 m), lo cual puede representar erróneamente la abundancia de peces de gran tamaño capturados para la pesca. Obtuvimos los datos de la estructura del tamaño corporal de 82 teleósteos marinos demersales focalizados por razones recreativas o comerciales tomados de 2,904 despliegues de video estéreo subacuático remoto con cebo (stereo‐BRUV, en inglés). El muestreo se realizó hasta los 50 metros de profundidad y abarcó aproximadamente 10,000 km del talud continental de Australia. El relieve marino, la profundidad del agua y la gravedad humana (es decir, un indicador de los impactos humanos) fueron los pronosticadores más sólidos de la probabilidad de incidencia de los peces de gran tamaño y de la abundancia de peces por encima del tamaño legal mínimo de captura. Las reservas marinas de protección total tienen un efecto positivo sobre la abundancia de los peces que están por encima del tamaño legal, aunque el efecto varió según el grupo de especies. Como contraste, los peces de tamaño sublegal fueron pronosticados de mejor manera usando gradientes de la temperatura de la superficie marina (media y varianza). En las áreas con un impacto humano reducido, los peces de gran tamaño corporal tenían hasta tres veces mayor probabilidad de aparecer y los peces de tamaño legal eran aproximadamente cinco veces más abundantes. Para los grupos de especies conspicuas con afinidades contrastantes de hábitat, ambiente y biogeografía, la abundancia de peces de tamaño legal normalmente declinó conforme aumentó el impacto humano. Nuestros análisis cuantitativos a gran escala resaltan la importancia conjunta que tienen la complejidad marina, las regiones con una huella humana reducida y las reservas marinas de protección total para la protección de los peces de gran tamaño corporal en una extensa gama de especies y configuraciones ecosistémicas.

                  The extensive nature of recreational angling makes it difficult to explore trends in global catches. However, trophy fishing world records may provide an insight into recreational fishing pressure on the largest species and size classes. Trophy fishing is promoted and recorded by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA), who manage an 80‐year database on the largest individuals of a species caught – called all‐tackle records (ATRs) – with information on the size and location of each record catch.
                
                
                  We analyse these data to explore temporal trends in the size of record‐setting fishes, determine how past and present ATR catches are distributed globally, and examine trends in records for International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) threatened species.
                
                
                  The number of ATRs, and the number of species awarded an ATR, have increased significantly over the past 80 years. New records are for increasingly smaller maximum‐sized species of fish, with the average sized record shifting from 167.7 kg in the 1950s to 8.1 kg in the 2010s. ATRs for species listed as threatened (Vulnerable or higher) on the IUCN Red List have also declined by approximately 66\% over the past two decades. Records were unevenly distributed around the world but have spread globally over time. Historically, ATRs were concentrated around the coastline of the USA but in recent decades more were reported in areas such as Japan and New Zealand.
                
                
                  These data either reflect a shift away from mainly targeting large taxa to targeting a wider variety of smaller species, or that there are now limited larger specimens and so fewer ATRs are being set. Additionally, the scarcity of new records for threatened species appears to support IUCN assessments of their poor stock status. The spread of ATRs suggests a growing pressure on the largest size classes in regions with previously little trophy fishing pressure. We encourage the greater use of catch‐and‐release initiatives and mandatory data collection for all near records to better quantify trophy fishing pressure and ensure sustainable practices.},

	abstract = {We develop the theory of biphasic somatic growth in ﬁsh using models based on the distinction between pre- and post-maturation growth and an explicit description of energy allocation within a growing season. We deﬁne a ‘generic biphasic’ (GB) model that assumes post-maturation growth has a von Bertalanffy (vB) form. For this model we derive an explicit expression for the gonad weight/somatic weight ratio (g) which may either remain ﬁxed or vary with size. Optimal biphasic models are then developed with reproductive strategies that maximise lifetime reproductive output. We consider two optimal growth models. In the ﬁrst (ﬁxed g optimal), gonad weight is constrained to be proportional to somatic weight. In the second (variable g optimal) model, allocation to reproduction is unconstrained and g increases with size. For the ﬁrst of these two models, adult growth in a scaled measure of length has the exact vB form. When there are no constraints on allocation, growth is vB to a very good approximation. In both models, pre-maturation growth is linear. In a companion paper we use growth data from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to test the bioenergetics assumptions used to develop these models, and demonstrate that they have advantages over the vB model, both in quality of ﬁt, and in the information contained in the ﬁtted parameters.},

The factors affecting whether abundance will increase within a reserve are well characterized; however, those results are based on long-term equilibria of population models. Here we use age-structured models of a generic ﬁsh population to analyze the short-term transient response. We show that it may take decades for a ﬁshed population to reach postreserve equilibrium. In the meantime, short-term transient dynamics dominate. During the transient phase, population abundance could either remain unchanged, decrease, or exhibit single-generation oscillations, regardless of the eventual long-term result. Such transient dynamics are longer and more oscillatory for populations with heavier ﬁshing, older ages at maturity, lower natural mortality rates, and lower larval connectivity. We provide metrics based on demographic data to describe the important characteristics of these postreserve transient dynamics.},

	abstract = {Three vertical ocean carbon pumps have been known for almost three decades to sequester atmospheric carbon in the deep-water and sediment reservoirs, i.e. the solubility pump, the carbonate pump, and the soft-tissue (also known as organic, or biological) carbon pump (BCP). These three pumps maintain the vertical gradient in total dissolved inorganic carbon between the surface and deep waters. The more recently proposed microbial carbon pump (MCP) would maintain a gradient between short- and longlived dissolved organic carbon (DOC; average lifetimes of {\textless}100 and {\textgreater}100 years, respectively). Long-lived DOC is an additional proposed reservoir of sequestered carbon in the ocean. This review: examines critically aspects of the vertical ocean carbon pumps and the MCP, in particular their physical dimensions and their potential roles in carbon sequestration; normalises the dimensions of the MCP to allow direct comparisons with the three vertical ocean carbon pumps; compares the MCP and vertical ocean carbon pumps; organises in a coherent framework the information available in the literature on refractory DOC; explores the potential effects of the globally changing ocean on the MCP; and identiﬁes the assumptions that generally underlie the MCP studies, as bases for future research. The study: proposes deﬁnitions of terms, expressions and concepts related to the four ocean carbon pumps (i.e. three vertical pumps and MCP); deﬁnes the magnitude for the MCP as the rate of production of DOC with an average lifetime of {\textgreater}100 years and provides its ﬁrst estimate for the World Ocean, i.e. 0.2 Pg C yearÀ1; and introduces an operational ‘‘ﬁrst-time-sequestration” criterion that prevents organic carbon ﬂuxes from being assigned to both the BCP and the MCP. In our review of the potential effects of predicted climate-related changes in the ocean environment on the MCP, we found that three of the seven predicted changes could potentially enhance carbon sequestration by the MCP, and three could diminish it.},

                  Increasing sea temperatures are predicted to decrease body size of marine ectotherms based on the temperature size rule. This will impact fisheries yields, but empirical evidence of the process is still limited.
                
                
                  We used fishery‐independent bottom trawl survey data from 1970 to 2017 to examine the trends of length‐at‐age of four commercially important demersal fish species (cod, haddock, whiting and saithe) in two study areas facing increasing sea temperatures: the West of Scotland and the North Sea. We then compared the trends of length‐at‐age with annual bottom sea temperatures.
                
                
                  The mean length‐at‐age of adults declined over the study period, in all species and in both areas, except for cod in the West of Scotland. A common trend of decline in adult length was inversely correlated with bottom sea temperatures. Correlations with temperature at seven yearly time‐lags were significant and negative in the North Sea. Correlations were only significant at lags of 1 and 2 years in the west of Scotland, where sea temperature warming was twice as slow.
                
                
                  The mean length‐at‐age of juveniles concurrently increased, which has not hitherto been reported. This trend, shared by all species and both regions, correlated positively with rising temperature, suggesting that our study species have a faster growth rate due to increased temperatures.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis and applications
                    . We examined the body size of a range of commercially exploited fish species, at different age groups, from two management regions. We found that juvenile fish have been getting bigger and adults smaller in both regions. These changes were correlated with rising sea temperatures, providing empirical evidence that global warming is affecting the size of commercial fish species. The effects of these changes on productivity of fish populations and fisheries yield now require investigation. Temperature changes should, therefore, be included into forecasts used in fisheries science in order to mitigate the impact of global warming and maximise sustainable yields.},

	abstract = {Minimizing the impact of ﬁshing is an explicit goal in international agreements as well as in regional directives and national laws. To assist in practical implementation, three simple rules for ﬁsheries management are proposed in this study: 1) take less than nature by ensuring that mortality caused by ﬁshing is less than the natural rate of mortality; 2) maintain population sizes above half of natural abundance, at levels where populations are still likely to be able to fulﬁl their ecosystem functions as prey or predator; and 3) let ﬁsh grow and reproduce, by adjusting the size at ﬁrst capture such that the mean length in the catch equals the length where the biomass of an unexploited cohort would be maximum (Lopt). For rule 3), the basic equations describing growth in age-structured populations are re-examined and a new optimum length for ﬁrst capture (Lc\_opt) is established. For a given rate of ﬁshing mortality, Lc\_opt keeps catch and proﬁt near their theoretical optima while maintaining large population sizes. Application of the three rules would not only minimize the impact of ﬁshing on commercial species, it may also achieve several goals of ecosystem-based ﬁsheries management, such as rebuilding the biomass of prey and predator species in the system and reducing collateral impact of ﬁshing, because with more ﬁsh in the water, shorter duration of gear deployment is needed for a given catch. The study also addresses typical criticisms of these common sense rules for ﬁsheries management.},

	abstract = {Natural mortality rate can be difﬁcult to estimate; consequently, indirect methods based on life history correlations are frequently used to infer values for stock assessments. One common class of predictors is based on the relationship between natural mortality rate and maximum age in unexploited or lightly exploited populations. The oldest age in a sample depends on the sample size, but there is confusion in the literature over the correct expression. Those attributable to Sarhan (1954) and Holt (1965) are correct. Kenchington’s (2014) estimators that incorporate sample size are mathematically ﬂawed and should not be used. Expressions exist for the expected value and variance of order statistics from an exponential distribution (including the maximum age), and these account for sample size. However, the resulting estimators are not recommended without evaluation of their performance because (1) they may not be robust to failures of the parametric assumptions, (2) it is often difﬁcult or impossible to determine the effective sample size, and (3) new estimators may not be needed because of the insensitivity of the maximum age to sample size. Empirical estimators based on regressing estimates of natural mortality rate from the literature on corresponding values of maximum age continue to be a viable approach. They do not use information on sample size, but fortunately the maximum observed age is insensitive to sample size provided the sample size is reasonably large. Sometimes, the maximum age from an exploited population is used with an empirical regression estimator. This can give an estimate close to the natural mortality rate if relict, old ﬁsh are largely protected by virtue of their habitat or their low vulnerability to capture. However, in general, use of maximum age from an exploited population tends to give an estimate somewhere between the natural mortality rate and the maximum total mortality that the stock has experienced.},

	abstract = {Empirical studies have shown that in teleosts there is a significant correlation between the life history parameters, age at first reproduction, natural mortality, and growth rate. In this paper 1 hypothesize that these correlations are the result of evolutionary adjustments due to the trade-off between reproduction, growth, and survival. A simple and reasonable assumption is that the costs of reproduction are sufficient to cause the l
              t
              m
              t
              function to decrease. A simple expression relating the age at first reproduction is derived from this assumption. This formula accounts for a statistically significant portion (60.6\%) of the variation in age at first reproduction in 30 stocks of fish. To extend the model to predict the distribution of life history parameters across all teleosts, an explicit cost function is incorporated. The model is analyzed with respect to two fitness measures, the expected lifetime fecundity and malthusian parameter, r. In the first case it is shown that the optimal age at maturity, T, depends only on the natural mortality rate (M) and the growth rate (k). In the second case, T is a function of k and the logarithm of a parameter, In C; the latter is a product of egg and larval survival, maximum body length (L
              x
              ), and the proportionality coefficient of the fecundity/length function. Difficulties of measuring egg and larval survival make the testing of the latter case difficult for particular species. However, this method provides a simple formula for the computation of r; this is shown generally to be approximately zero, thereby adding strength to the assumptions of the first analysis. The distribution patterns of T on k and M on k are predicted and compared with the observed pattern. In general, the predictions are validated: however, certain combinations of k and ln C are shown to occur very infrequently. The prediction of such "empty" regions of the parameter space remains a challenge for future development of life history theory.},

Fisheries size-frequency data are usually grouped over size intervals and the efficient methods are easily programmed on a computer for this case. We show that several published alternatives offer no computational advantages over our method. We describe an interactive computer program that assists the user in determining which parameters may be estimated from a set of data. The program alternates between constrained direct-search optimization and fast iterative calculations. Two examples of fisheries length-frequency data show that fitting is made easier by employing a subsample aged by biological methods for the preliminary starting values of parameters, and that the best fit may involve a trade-off between statistical precision and biological plausibility. The value of mixture analysis to the fishery worker is to reduce field and laboratory time in the aging of large samples.

A compiled data set comprising 29 582 records of individual prey eaten at 21 locations by individual predators that spanned 10 orders of magnitude in mass and lived in marine environments ranging from the poles to the tropics was used to investigate the inﬂuence of predator size and environment on predator and prey size relationships. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated that predator–prey mass ratios (PPMR) increased with predator mass. The amount of the increase varied among locations and predator species and individuals but was not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by temperature, latitude, depth, or primary production. Increases in PPMR with predator mass implied nonlinear relationships between log body mass and trophic level and reductions in transfer efﬁciency with increasing body size. The results suggest that very general rules determine dominant trends in PPMR in diverse marine ecosystems, leading to the ubiquity of size-based trophic structuring and the consistency of observed relationships between the relative abundance of individuals and their body size.},

	abstract = {Metabolic theory aims to tackle ecological and evolutionary problems by explicitly including physical principles of energy and mass exchange, thereby increasing generality and deductive power. Individual growth models (IGMs) are the fundamental basis of metabolic theory because they represent the organisational level at which energy and mass exchange processes are most tightly integrated and from which scaling patterns emerge. Unfortunately, IGMs remain a topic of great confusion and controversy about the origins of the ideas, their domain and breadth of application, their logical consistency and whether they can sufﬁciently capture reality. It is now 100 years since the ﬁrst theoretical model of individual growth was put forward by Pütter. His insights were deep, but his model ended up being attributed to von Bertalanffy and his ideas largely forgotten. Here I review Pütter’s ideas and trace their inﬂuence on existing theoretical models for growth and other aspects of metabolism, including those of von Bertalanffy, the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, the GillOxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT) and the Ontogenetic Growth Model (OGM). I show that the von Bertalanffy and GOLT models are minor modiﬁcations of Pütter’s original model. I then synthesise, compare and critique the ideas of the two most-developed theories, DEB theory and the OGM, in relation to Pütter’s original ideas. I formulate the Pütter, DEB and OGM models in the same structure and with the same notation to illustrate the major similarities and differences among them. I trace the confusion and controversy regarding these theories to the notions of anabolism, catabolism, assimilation and maintenance, the connections to respiration rate, and the number of parameters and state variables their models require. The OGM model has signiﬁcant inconsistencies that stem from the interpretation of growth as the difference between anabolism and maintenance, and these issues seriously challenge its ability to incorporate development, reproduction and assimilation. The DEB theory is a direct extension of Pütter’s ideas but with growth being the difference between assimilation and maintenance rather than anabolism and catabolism. The DEB theory makes the dynamics of Pütter’s ‘nutritive material’ explicit as well as extending the scheme to include reproduction and development. I discuss how these three major theories for individual growth have been used to explain ‘macrometabolic’ patterns including the scaling of respiration, the temperature–size rule (ﬁrst modelled by Pütter), and the connection to life history. Future research on the connections between theory and data in these macrometabolic topics have the greatest potential to advance the status of metabolic theory and its value for pure and applied problems in ecology and evolution.},

                  Fishing and climate change are profoundly impacting marine biota through unnatural selection and exposure to potentially stressful environmental conditions. Their effects, however, are often considered in isolation, and then only at the population level, despite there being great potential for synergistic selection on the individual.
                
                
                  We explored how fishing and climate variability interact to affect an important driver of fishery productivity and population dynamics: individual growth rate. We projected that average growth rate would increase as waters warm, a harvest‐induced release from density dependence would promote adult growth, and that fishing would increase the sensitivity of somatic growth to temperature.
                
                
                  
                    We measured growth increments from the otoliths of 400 purple wrasse (
                    Notolabrius funicola
                    ), a site‐attached temperate marine reef fish inhabiting an ocean warming hotspot. These were used to generate nearly two decades of annually resolved growth estimates from three populations spanning a period before and after the onset of commercial fishing. We used hierarchical models to partition variation in growth within and between individuals and populations, and attribute it to intrinsic (age, individual‐specific) and extrinsic (local and regional climate, fishing) drivers.
                  
                
                
                  At the population scale, we detected predictable additive increases in average growth rate associated with warming and a release from density dependence. A fishing–warming synergy only became apparent at the individual scale where harvest resulted in the 50\% reduction of thermal growth reaction norm diversity. This phenotypic change was primarily caused by the loss of larger individuals that showed a strong positive response to temperature change after the onset of size‐selective harvesting.
                
                
                  We speculate that the dramatic loss of individual‐level biocomplexity is caused by either inadvertent fisheries selectivity based on behaviour, or the disruption of social hierarchies resulting from the selective harvesting of large, dominant and resource‐rich individuals. Whatever the cause, the removal of individuals that display a positive growth response to temperature could substantially reduce species’ capacity to adapt to climate change at temperatures well below those previously thought stressful.},

	abstract = {Fisheries harvest has pervasive impacts on wild fish populations, including the truncation of size and age structures, altered population dynamics and density, and modified habitat and assemblage composition. Understanding the degree to which harvest-induced impacts increase the sensitivity of individuals, populations and ultimately species to environmental change is essential to ensuring sustainable fisheries management in a rapidly changing world. Here we generated multiple long-term (44–62 years), annually resolved, somatic growth chronologies of four commercially important fishes from New Zealand's coastal and shelf waters. We used these novel data to investigate how regional- and basin-scale environmental variability, in concert with fishing activity, affected individual somatic growth rates and the magnitude of spatial synchrony among stocks. Changes in somatic growth can affect individual fitness and a range of population and fishery metrics such as recruitment success, maturation schedules and stock biomass. Across all species, individual growth benefited from a fishing-induced release of density controls. For nearshore snapper and tarakihi, regional-scale wind and temperature also additively affected growth, indicating that future climate change-induced warming and potentially strengthened winds will initially promote the productivity of more poleward populations. Fishing increased the sensitivity of deep-water hoki and ling growth to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). A forecast shift to a positive IPO phase, in concert with current harvest strategies, will likely promote individual hoki and ling growth. At the species level, historical fishing practices and IPO synergized to strengthen spatial synchrony in average growth between stocks separated by 400–600 nm of ocean. Increased spatial synchrony can, however, increase the vulnerability of stocks to deleterious stochastic events. Together, our individual- and species-level results show how fishing and environmental factors can conflate to initially promote individual growth but then possibly heighten the sensitivity of stocks to environmental change.},

To examine the relevance of this equation, we undertook a metaanalysis of published relationships between functional response parameters and temperature. We show that, when plotted in lin-log space, temperature dependence of both attack rate and maximal ingestion rate exhibits a hump-shaped relationship and not a linear one as predicted by the Arrhenius equation. The relationship remains signiﬁcantly downward concave even when data from temperatures above the peak of the hump are discarded. Temperature dependence is stronger for attack rate than for maximal ingestion rate, but the thermal optima are not different. We conclude that the use of the Arrhenius equation to describe consumption in predator–prey models requires the assumption that temperatures above thermal optima are unimportant for population and community dynamics, an assumption that is untenable given the available data.},

	abstract = {The dominant paradigm for assessing ecological responses to climate change assumes that future states of individuals and populations can be predicted by current, species-wide performance variation across spatial climatic gradients. However, if the fates of ecological systems are better predicted by past responses to in situ climatic variation through time, this current analytical paradigm may be severely misleading. Empirically testing whether spatial or temporal climate responses better predict how species respond to climate change has been elusive, largely due to restrictive data requirements. Here, we leverage a newly collected network of ponderosa pine tree-ring time series to test whether statistically inferred responses to spatial versus temporal climatic variation better predict how trees have responded to recent climate change. When compared to observed tree growth responses to climate change since 1980, predictions derived from spatial climatic variation were wrong in both magnitude and direction. This was not the case for predictions derived from climatic variation through time, which were able to replicate observed responses well. Future climate scenarios through the end of the 21st century exacerbated these disparities. These results suggest that the currently dominant paradigm of forecasting the ecological impacts of climate change based on spatial climatic variation may be severely misleading over decadal to centennial timescales.},

While it is considered to be one of the few consistent patterns in ecology, spatiotemporal variation of this relationship across continental scale temperature gradients is unknown. Using a database of stream communities collected across North America (18–­68°N latitude, −4 to 25°C mean annual air temperature) over 3 years, we constructed 160 individual size distribution (ISD) relationships (i.e. abundance size spectra). The exponent parameter describing ISD’s decreased (became steeper) with increasing mean annual temperature, with median slopes varying by {\textasciitilde}0.2 units across the 29°C temperature gradient. In addition, total community biomass increased with increasing temperatures, contrary with theoretical predictions. Our study suggests conservation of ISD relationships in streams across broad natural environmental gradients. This supports the emerging use of size-­spectra deviations as indicators of fundamental changes to the structure and function of ecological communities.},

Known as the temperature-­size rule (TSR), this pattern is commonly attributed to higher metabolism in warmer waters, leaving fewer resources for growth. An alternative explanation focuses on growth and reproduction trade-­offs across temperatures. We tested these hypotheses by measuring growth, maturation, metabolism and reproductive allocation from zebrafish populations kept at 26 and 30°C across six generations. Zebrafish growth and maturation followed TSR expectations but were not explained by baseline metabolic rate, which converged between temperature treatments after a few generations. Rather, we found that females at 30°C allocated more to reproduction, especially when maturing at the smallest sizes. We show that elevated temperatures do not necessarily increase baseline metabolism if sufficient acclimation is allowed and call for an urgent revision of modelling assumptions used to predict population and ecosystem responses to warming.},

However, predictions of the effects of climate change on the productivity and dynamics of marine fishes are hampered by a lack of historical data on growth patterns. We use otolith biochronologies to show that the strength of a boundary current, modulated by the El Nin{\textasciitilde}o-Southern Oscillation, accounted for almost half of the shared variance in annual growth patterns of five of six species of tropical and temperate marine fishes across 23° of latitude (3000 km) in Western Australia.

Our work is the first to link the growth patterns of multiple fishes with a single oceanographic/climate phenomenon at large spatial scales and across multiple climate zones, habitat types, trophic levels and depth ranges. Extreme La Nin{\textasciitilde}a and El Nin{\textasciitilde}o events are predicted to occur more frequently in the future and these are likely to have implications for these vulnerable ecosystems, such as a limited capacity of the marine taxa to recover from stressful climatic events.},

                  Directional or stabilising selection should drive the expression of a dominant movement phenotype within a population. Widespread persistence of multiple movement phenotypes within wild populations, however, suggests that individuals that move (movers) and those that do not (residents) can have commensurate performance.
                
                
                  The costs and benefits of mover and resident phenotypes remain poorly understood. Here, we explored how the presence and timing of movements are correlated with annual somatic growth rates, a useful proxy for performance because it is easily measured and rapidly reflects environmental changes.
                
                
                  
                    We used otolith growth measurements and stable isotope analyses to recreate growth and among‐reach movement histories of a partially migrating, long‐lived freshwater fish, golden perch
                    Macquaria ambigua
                    . We compared the association between movement and growth at two temporal scales: (a) short‐term (annual) differences in growth, in the years preceding, during or following movement; and (b) long‐term (lifetime) differences in growth.
                  
                
                
                  Overall, 59\% of individuals performed at least one among‐reach movement, with these individuals subsequently more likely to move repeatedly throughout their lives. Movers grew faster than residents, with this difference most pronounced in the juvenile and early adult stages, when most movements occurred. Annual growth did not, however, change immediately prior to or following a specific movement event. Among‐individual variation in growth was initially higher for residents than for movers but decreased with age, at a faster rate for residents than for movers, such that levels conformed after 5 years of age.
                
                
                  Our results indicate that lifetime movement is linked to faster growth in the early years of a fish's life. These faster growing movers are likely to be larger at a given age, leading to numerous potential benefits. However, the persistence of resident phenotypes suggests that there is likely a cost–benefit trade‐off to moving. The presence of multiple movement phenotypes may contribute to the resilience of populations by buffering against naturally and anthropogenically exacerbated environmental variability.},

	abstract = {Growth is a fundamental biological process, driven by a multitude of intrinsic (within-individual) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, that underpins individual ﬁtness and population demographics. Focusing on the comprehensive information stored in aquatic and terrestrial organism hard parts, we develop a series of increasingly complex hierarchical models to explore spatial and temporal sources of growth variation, ranging in resolution from within individuals to across a species. We apply this modeling framework to an extensive data set of otolith increment measurements from tiger ﬂathead (Platycephalus richardsoni), a demersal commercially exploited ﬁsh that inhabits the warming waters of southeast Australia. We recreated growth histories (biochronology) up to four decades in length from seven ﬁshing areas spanning this species’ range. The dominant pattern in annual growth was an age-dependent, allometric decline that varied among individuals, sexes, ﬁshing areas, years, and cohorts. We found evidence for among-area differences in growth-rate selectivity, whereby younger ﬁsh at capture were generally faster growers. Temporal growth variation was partitioned into two main sources: extrinsic year to year annual ﬂuctuations in environmental conditions and persistent cohortspeciﬁc growth differences, reﬂecting density dependence and/or juvenile experience. Despite low levels of among-individual growth synchrony within areas, we detected a regionally coherent signal of increasing average growth rate through time, a trend related to oceanic warming. At the southerly (poleward) range limit, growth was only weakly related to temperature, but farther north in warmer waters this relationship strengthened until closer to the species’ equatorward range limit, growth declined with increasing temperatures. We partitioned these species-wide and area-speciﬁc phenotypic responses into within- and among-individual components using a reaction norm approach. Individual tiger ﬂathead likely possess sufﬁcient growth plasticity to successfully adapt to warming waters across much of their range, but increased future warming in the north will continue to depress growth, affecting individual ﬁtness and even population persistence. Our modeling framework is directly applicable to other long-term, individual-based, data sets such as those derived from tree rings, corals, and tag–recapture studies, and provides an unprecedented level of resolution into the drivers of growth variation and the ecological and evolutionary implications of environmental and climatic change.},

Energetic equivalence predicts that density scales with body size as N ∝ M–0.75 and that biomass scales with body size as B ∝ M0.25. However, the way fish size-spectra are influenced by external processes, such as ecological subsidies (e.g. nutrients from upwelling zones) and fisheries management, is not well understood. We investigated the relationship of body size with density and biomass of reef fishes associated with subtidal kelp forests of Lessonia trabeculata that were influenced by the separate and interactive effects of management (Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries [TURF] or open access) and upwelling regimes (upwelling or non-upwelling zones). Fish densities and lengths were recorded using underwater visual censuses. Within each of 4 locations, paired TURF and open-access sites were surveyed. We surveyed 18 fish species, encompassing 1511 individuals ranging between 2 and 6639 g. We observed that fish size-spectra deviated from energetic equivalence, as N ∝ M–0.32 and B ∝ M2.2, indicating that the contribution of large-sized fishes to community density and biomass was greater than that predicted by energetic equivalence. Multi-model inference suggested that TURF and upwelling scenarios had weak effects on fish size-spectra. Results indicated that fish communities may have access to external food sources beyond local kelp forests. In addition, size-spectra may be a spatially persistent attribute of these fish communities.},

We assembled trends in abundance and harvest rate of stocks that are scientifically assessed, constituting half of the reported global marine fish catch. For these stocks, on average, abundance is increasing and is at proposed target levels. Compared with regions that are intensively managed, regions with less-developed fisheries management have, on average, 3-fold greater harvest rates and half the abundance as assessed stocks. Available evidence suggests that the regions without assessments of abundance have little fisheries management, and stocks are in poor shape. Increased application of area-appropriate fisheries science recommendations and management tools are still needed for sustaining fisheries in places where they are lacking.},

                  Somatic growth is a fundamental property of living organisms, and is of particular importance for species with indeterminate growth that can change in size continuously throughout their life. For example, fishes can increase in size by 2–6 orders of magnitude during their lifetime, resulting in changes in production, consumption and function at the ecosystem scale. Within species, growth rates are traded off against other life‐history parameters, hence an accurate description of growth is essential to understand the comparative demography, productivity, fisheries yield and extinction risk of populations and species.
                
                
                  
                    The growth trajectory of indeterminate growing sharks and rays (elasmobranchs) and bony fishes (teleosts) is usually modelled using a three‐parameter logarithmic function, the von Bertalanffy growth function (
                    VBGF
                    ), to describe the total length of the average individual at any given age. Recently, however, a two‐parameter form has gained popularity. Rather than being estimated in the model fitting process, the third y‐intercept parameter (
                    L
                    0
                    ) of the
                    VBGF
                    has been interpreted as being biologically equivalent to, and thus fixed as, the empirically estimated size at birth.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We tested the equivalence assumption that
                    L
                    0
                    is the same or similar to size at birth by comparing empirical estimates of size at birth available from the literature with estimates of
                    L
                    0
                    from published data from elasmobranchs, and found that even though there is an overlap of values, there is a high degree of variability between them.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We calculate the bias in the growth coefficient (
                    k
                    ) of the
                    VBGF
                    by comparison between the two‐ and three‐parameter estimation methods. We show that slight deviations in fixed
                    L
                    0
                    can cause considerable bias in growth estimates in the two‐parameter
                    VBGF
                    while providing no benefit even when
                    L
                    0
                    matches the true value. We show that the effect of this biased growth estimate has profound consequences for fisheries stock status.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We strongly recommend the use of the three‐parameter
                    VBGF
                    and discourage use of the two‐parameter
                    VBGF
                    because it results in substantially biased growth estimates even with slight variations in the value of fixed

	abstract = {Humans are changing marine ecosystems worldwide, both directly through fishing and indirectly through climate change. One of the little explored outcomes of human-induced change involves the decreasing body sizes of fishes. We use a marine ecosystem model to explore how a slow (less than 0.1\% per year) decrease in the length of five harvested species could affect species interactions, biomasses and yields. We find that even small decreases in fish sizes are amplified by positive feedback loops in the ecosystem and can lead to major changes in natural mortality. For some species, a total of 4 per cent decrease in length-at-age over 50 years resulted in 50 per cent increase in predation mortality. However, the magnitude and direction in predation mortality changes differed among species and one shrinking species even experienced reduced predation pressure. Nevertheless, 50 years of gradual decrease in body size resulted in 1–35\% decrease in biomasses and catches of all shrinking species. Therefore, fisheries management practices that ignore contemporary life-history changes are likely to overestimate long-term yields and can lead to overfishing.},

	abstract = {Bergmann's rule is a widely-accepted biogeographic rule stating that individuals within a species are smaller in warmer environments. While there are many single-species studies and integrative reviews documenting this pattern, a data-intensive approach has not been used yet to determine the generality of this pattern. We assessed the strength and direction of the intraspecific relationship between temperature and individual mass for 952 bird and mammal species. For eighty-seven percent of species, temperature explained less than 10\% of variation in mass, and for 79\% of species the correlation was not statistically significant. These results suggest that Bergmann's rule is not general and temperature is not a dominant driver of biogeographic variation in mass. Further understanding of size variation will require integrating multiple processes that influence size. The lack of dominant temperature forcing weakens the justification for the hypothesis that global warming could result in widespread decreases in body size.
          , 
            Scientists have found that individual animals of the same species tend to be smaller in hotter environments and larger in cooler ones. They named this pattern “Bergmann’s Rule” to describe how temperature can influence the size of an animal. However, most studies of Bergmann’s Rule have only looked at one or a few species at a time.
            Knowing how many species follow this rule is important because globally rising temperatures could cause lots of species to become smaller. Since the size of organisms affects how much food and space they need, this could disrupt natural systems around the world.
            To test if Bergmann’s rule can be extended to many species, Riemer, Guralnick, and White assessed the relationship between temperature and body mass for 952 bird and mammal species. Contrary to Bergmann’s Rule, the results showed that most of the species had similar sizes regardless of the temperature of their environment. Only about 140 species were smaller in hotter environments, and about 70 species were larger in hotter environments. This suggest that Bergmann’s Rule does not apply to most species as expected.
            While most birds and mammals may not get bigger or smaller due to warming global temperatures, the few species that do change in size – and the species that interact with them – may be more likely to become endangered or extinct. If we can determine which animals are at risk, we can prioritize their conservation and design better plans for doing so. Losing even a single species disrupts our ecosystems, on which we rely for critical resources like food, building materials, and clean air.},

However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

Populations of John’s Snapper farthest from the equator had the largest body sizes, in line with James’s rule, and the fastest growth rates, contrary to the temperaturesize rule for ectotherms. A maximum age of 28.6 years, nearly 3 times previous estimates, was recorded and the largest individual was 990 mm in fork length. Females grew to a larger mean asymptotic fork length (L∞) than did males, a ﬁnding consistent with functional gonochorism. Otolith weight at age and gonad weight at length followed the same latitudinal trends seen in length at age. Length at maturity was {\textasciitilde}72–87\% of L∞ and varied by {\textasciitilde}23\% across the full latitudinal gradient, but age at first maturity was consistently in the range of 6–10 years, indicating that basic growth trajectories were similar across vastly different environments.

Community mean body size change was driven by differential temperature responses within trophic groups and temperature-­driven change in their relative abundance. Herbivores, invertivores and planktivores became smaller on average in warmer temperatures, but no trend was found in piscivores. Nearly 25\% of the temperature-r­ elated community mean size trend was attributable to trophic composition at the warmest sites, but at colder temperatures, this was {\textless}1\% due to trophic groups being similarly sized.

	abstract = {Life history theory predicts a range of directional generic responses in life history traits with increasing organism size. Among these are the relationships between size and longevity, mortality, growth rate, timing of maturity, and lifetime reproductive output. Spanning three orders of magnitude in size, coral reef ﬁshes provide an ecologically diverse and species-rich vertebrate assemblage in which to test these generic responses. Here we examined these relationships by quantifying the life cycles of three miniature species of coral reef ﬁsh from the genus Eviota (Gobiidae) and compared their life history characteristics with other reef ﬁsh species. We found that all three species of Eviota have life spans of ,100 days, suffer high daily mortality rates of 7–8\%, exhibit rapid linear growth, and matured at an earlier than expected size. Although lifetime reproductive output was low, consistent with their small body sizes, short generation times of 47–74 days help overcome low individual fecundity and appear to be a critical feature in maintaining Eviota populations. Comparisons with other coral reef ﬁsh species showed that Eviota species live on the evolutionary margins of life history possibilities for vertebrate animals. This addition of demographic information on these smallest size classes of coral reef ﬁshes greatly extends our knowledge to encompass the full size spectrum and highlights the potential for coral reef ﬁshes to contribute to vertebrate life history studies.},

                  The decomposition of variation in population growth into the relative contributions from different demographic rates has multiple uses in population, conservation and evolutionary biology. Recent research has favoured methods based on matrix models termed ‘life‐table‐response experiments’ or more generally ‘the retrospective matrix method’, which provide an approximation of a complete demographic decomposition. The performance of the approximation has not been assessed.
                
                
                  We compare the performance of the retrospective matrix method to a complete decomposition for two bighorn sheep populations and one red deer population.
                
                
                  Different demographic rates make markedly different contributions to variation in growth rate between populations, because each population is subject to different types of environmental variation.
                
                
                  The most influential demographic rates identified from decomposing observed variation in population growth are often not those showing the highest elasticity. Consequently, those demographic rates most strongly associated with deterministic population growth are not necessarily strongly associated with temporal variation in population growth.
                
                
                  The retrospective matrix method provides a good approximation of the demographic rate associated most strongly with variation in population growth. However, failure to incorporate the contribution of covariation between demographic rates when decomposing variation in population growth can lead to spurious conclusions.},

	abstract = {The Beverton and Holt invariants are three special relations among life history parameters: Mxm = C1, M/K = C2, and L(xm)/Linf = C3, where M is the instantaneous natural mortality rate per individual, xm is age at maturity, K is the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, L(xm) is length at maturity, Linf is asymptotic length, and C1, C2, and C3 are constants. In this study the Beverton and Holt invariants were obtained from maximization of the fecundity function that optimizes the trade-off between survival and fecundity; this approach applies conventional fishery models and provides estimates of the constants C1, C2, and C3. These estimates can be compared with the estimates obtained by regression of 1/M on xm, M on K, and L(xm) on Linf across species and across populations within species. The values of the constants obtained from regression across species agree closely with the theoretical values of the constants. In fishery assessments, natural mortality is often approximated using growth parameters, and the analyses reported here indicate that the relations are not just statistical relations, but rather result from fundamental ecological relations among the parameters.},

	abstract = {A stronger focus on natural mortality may be required to better understand contemporary changes in ﬁsh life histories and behaviour and their responses to anthropogenic drivers. Firstly, natural mortality is the selection under which ﬁsh evolved in the ﬁrst place, so a theoretical understanding of effects of natural mortality alone is needed. Secondly, due to trade-offs, most organismal functions can only be achieved at some cost in terms of survival. Several trade-offs might need to be analysed simultaneously with effects on natural mortality being a common currency. Thirdly, there is scattered evidence that natural mortality has been increasing, some would say dramatically, in some ﬁshed stocks, which begs explanations. Fourthly, natural mortality most often implies transfer of mass and energy from one species to another, and therefore has foodweb and ecosystem consequences. We therefore analyse a model for evolution of ﬁsh life histories and behaviour, where state-dependent energy-allocation and growth strategies are found by optimization. Natural mortality is split into ﬁve different components, each speciﬁed as the outcome of individual traits and ecological tradeoffs: a ﬁxed baseline mortality; size-dependent predation; risk-dependent growth strategy; a ﬁxed mortality when sexually mature; and mortality increasing with reproductive investment. The analysis is repeated with and without ﬁshing. Each component of natural mortality has consequences for optimal life history strategies. Beyond earlier models, we show i) how the two types of reproductive mortality sometimes have similar and sometimes contrasting effects on life history evolution, ii) how ecosystem properties such as food availability and predation levels have stronger effects on optimal strategies than changing other mortality components, and iii) how expected changes in risk-dependent growth strategies are highly variable depending on the type of mortality changed.},

	abstract = {Biotic responses to global change include directional shifts in organismal traits. Body size, an integrative trait that determines demographic rates and ecosystem functions, is thought to be shrinking in the Anthropocene. Here, we assessed the prevalence of body size change in six taxon groups across 5025 assemblage time series spanning 1960 to 2020. Using the Price equation to partition this change into within-species body size versus compositional changes, we detected prevailing decreases in body size through time driven primarily by fish, with more variable patterns in other taxa. We found that change in assemblage composition contributes more to body size changes than within-species trends, but both components show substantial variation in magnitude and direction. The biomass of assemblages remains quite stable as decreases in body size trade off with increases in abundance.

            Editor’s summary
            
              Large organisms may be particularly susceptible to impacts from human activities, including hunting and harvesting, as well as the stress of climate change. Martins
              et al
              . analyzed body-size trends in plant and animal communities since 1960 from the BioTIME database and separated the effects of changes within species from those driven by species composition. They found that trends varied across communities, with marine fish more consistently shifted toward smaller body size. Mean body size changed within populations, but community-level trends were more affected by changes in the abundance of small- and large-bodied species. Biomass generally stayed stable over time, suggesting that more small individuals were present despite the loss of larger ones. —Bianca Lopez

Still, the general distribution of consumer–resource body-size ratios in real ecosystems, and whether they vary systematically among habitats or broad taxonomic groups, is poorly understood. Using a unique global database on consumer and resource body sizes, we show that the mean bodysize ratios of aquatic herbivorous and detritivorous consumers are several orders of magnitude larger than those of carnivorous predators. Carnivorous predator–prey body-size ratios vary across different habitats and predator and prey types (invertebrates, ectotherm, and endotherm vertebrates). Predator–prey body-size ratios are on average signiﬁcantly higher (1) in freshwater habitats than in marine or terrestrial habitats, (2) for vertebrate than for invertebrate predators, and (3) for invertebrate than for ectotherm vertebrate prey. If recent studies that relate body-size ratios to interaction strengths are general, our results suggest that mean consumer–resource interaction strengths may vary systematically across different habitat categories and consumer types.},

Here we discuss more sophisticated methods for ﬁtting these exponents based on cumulative distribution functions and maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate their superior performance at estimating known exponents and provide details on how and when ecologists should use them.

            The spawning potential ratio (SPR) is a well-established biological reference point, and estimates of SPR could be used to inform management decisions for data-poor fisheries. Simulations were used to investigate the utility of the length-based model (LB-SPR) developed in Hordyk et al. (2015). Some explorations of the life history ratios to describe length composition, spawning-per-recruit, and the spawning potential ratio. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 72: 204–216.) to estimate the SPR of a stock directly from the size composition of the catch. This was done by (i) testing some of the main assumptions of the LB-SPR model, including recruitment variability and dome-shaped selectivity, (ii) examining the sensitivity of the model to error in the input parameters, and (iii) completing an initial empirical test for the LB-SPR model by applying it to data from a well-studied species. The method uses maximum likelihood methods to find the values of relative fishing mortality (F/M) and selectivity-at-length that minimize the difference between the observed and the expected length composition of the catch, and calculates the resulting SPR. When parameterized with the correct input parameters, the LB-SPR model returned accurate estimates of F/M and SPR. With high variability in annual recruitment, the estimates of SPR became increasingly unreliable. The usefulness of the LB-SPR method was tested empirically by comparing the results predicted by the method with those for a well-described species with known length and age composition data. The results from this comparison suggest that the LB-SPR method has potential to provide a tool for the cost-effective assessment of data-poor fisheries. However, the model is sensitive to non-equilibrium dynamics, and requires accurate estimates of the three parameters (M/k, L∞, and CVL∞). Care must be taken to evaluate the validity of the assumptions and the biological parameters when the model is applied to data-poor fisheries.},

The theoretical underpinning for fish shrinking is that the oxygen supply to large fish size cannot be met by their gills, whose surface area cannot keep up with the oxygen demand by their three-dimensional bodies. However, Lefevre et al. (Global Change Biology, 2017, 23, 3449–3459) argue against such theory. Here, we reassert, with the Gill-Oxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT), that gills, which must retain the properties of open surfaces because their growth, even while hyperallometric, cannot keep up with the demand of growing three-dimensional bodies. Also, we show that a wide range of biological features of fish and other water-breathing organisms can be understood when gill area limitation is used as an explanation. We also note that an alternative to GOLT, offering a more parsimonious explanation for these features of water-breathers has not been proposed. Available empirical evidence corroborates predictions of decrease in body sizes under ocean warming based on GOLT, with the magnitude of the predicted change increases when using more species-specific parameter values of metabolic scaling.},

            Evaluating the status of data-poor fish stocks is often limited by incomplete knowledge of the basic life history parameters: the natural mortality rate (M), the von Bertalanffy growth parameters (L∞ and k), and the length at maturity (Lm). A common approach to estimate these individual parameters has been to use the Beverton–Holt life history invariants, the ratios M/k and Lm/L∞, especially for estimating M. In this study, we assumed no knowledge of the individual parameters, and explored how the information on life history strategy contained in these ratios can be applied to assessing data-poor stocks. We developed analytical models to develop a relationship between M/k and the von Bertalanffy growth curve, and demonstrate the link between the life history ratios and yield- and spawning-per-recruit. We further developed the previously recognized relationship between M/k and yield- and spawning-per-recruit by using information on Lm/L∞, knife-edge selectivity (Lc/L∞), and the ratio of fishing to natural mortality (F/M), to demonstrate the link between an exploited stock's expected length composition, and its spawning potential ratio (SPR), an internationally recognized measurement of stock status. Variation in length-at-age and logistic selectivity patterns were incorporated in the model to demonstrate how SPR can be calculated from the observed size composition of the catch; an advance which has potential as a cost-effective method for assessing data-poor stocks. A companion paper investigates the effects of deviations in the main assumptions of the model on the application of the analytical models developed in this study as a cost-effective method for stock assessment [Hordyk, A.

We also discuss some power-law distributions emerging in the analysis of numbers and ﬂuctuations in ecological attributes as they point to regularities that are yet to be integrated with traditional scaling relationships and which we foresee as an exciting area of future research.},

	abstract = {Understanding how animals interact with their environment is critical for evaluating, mitigating and coping with anthropogenic alteration of Earth’s biosphere. Researchers have attempted to understand some aspects of these interactions by examining patterns in animal body mass distributions. Energetic, phylogenetic, biogeographical, textural discontinuity and community interaction hypotheses have been advanced to explain observed patterns. Energetic and textural discontinuity hypotheses focus upon the allometry of resource use. The community interaction hypothesis contends that biotic interactions within assemblages of species are of primary importance. Biogeographical and phylogenetic hypotheses focus on the role of constraints on the organization of communities. This paper examines and organizes these various propositions about species body mass distributions and discusses the multiple competing hypotheses, how their predictions vary, and possible methods by which the hypotheses can be distinguished and tested. Each of the hypotheses is partial, and explains some elements of pattern in body mass distributions. The scale of appropriate application, relevance and interpretation varies among the hypotheses, and the mechanisms underlying observed patterns are likely to be multicausal and vary with scale.},

            Empirical laws portraying patterns in ecology are routinely observed in marine and terrestrial environments. Such patterns are recurrent but also show features that are distinctive of each ecosystem. For example, the number of species in an ecosystem increases with its area according to a well-defined mathematical law, but the rate of increase may vary across different ecosystem types. We show that different ecological patterns are linked to each other in a way that if one is changed, the others are affected as well. We verify our predictions on available empirical datasets and unravel yet unknown features of natural ecosystems, suggesting directions for empirical research.
          , 
            Scaling laws in ecology, intended both as functional relationships among ecologically relevant quantities and the probability distributions that characterize their occurrence, have long attracted the interest of empiricists and theoreticians. Empirical evidence exists of power laws associated with the number of species inhabiting an ecosystem, their abundances, and traits. Although their functional form appears to be ubiquitous, empirical scaling exponents vary with ecosystem type and resource supply rate. The idea that ecological scaling laws are linked has been entertained before, but the full extent of macroecological pattern covariations, the role of the constraints imposed by finite resource supply, and a comprehensive empirical verification are still unexplored. Here, we propose a theoretical scaling framework that predicts the linkages of several macroecological patterns related to species’ abundances and body sizes. We show that such a framework is consistent with the stationary-state statistics of a broad class of resource-limited community dynamics models, regardless of parameterization and model assumptions. We verify predicted theoretical covariations by contrasting empirical data and provide testable hypotheses for yet unexplored patterns. We thus place the observed variability of ecological scaling exponents into a coherent statistical framework where patterns in ecology embed constrained fluctuations.},

First, the method to calculate equilibrium numbers-at-length is incomplete and leads to negatively biased estimates of ﬁshing mortality. Second, inadequate simulation testing fails to reveal that the method is highly sensitive to assumptions of equilibrium conditions and that the population average asymptotic length (L1) can be approximated by the largest observed size (Lmax). Finally, the Froese et al. (2018) model relies on the assumption that the ratio of natural mortality (M) to the von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K; M/K) is typically around 1.5, which they argue is supported by the literature for most ﬁsh stocks. We believe that this conclusion is based on an insufﬁcient reading of the literature and, in fact, there is strong evidence to support the claim that M/K is outside the narrow bounds of 1.2–1.8 for many exploited species. Potential users of the method are alerted to these issues and alternative approaches are recommended to avoid these biases.},

We derive the abundance of species as a function of their asymptotic size. The derivation is based on size-spectrum theory, where population structure is derived from physiology and simple arguments regarding the predator-prey interaction. Using a hypothesis of constant satiation, which states that the average degree of satiation is independent of the size of an organism, the number of individuals with a given size is found to be proportional to the weight raised to the power Ϫ2.05, independent of the predator/prey size ratio. This is the ﬁrst time the spectrum exponent has been derived solely on the basis of processes at the individual level. The theory furthermore predicts that the parameters in the von Bertalanffy growth function are related as K ∝ LϪϱ1.},

LBB works for species that grow throughout their lives, such as most commercially-important ﬁsh and invertebrates, and requires no input in addition to length frequency data. It estimates asymptotic length, length at ﬁrst capture, relative natural mortality, and relative ﬁshing mortality. Standard ﬁsheries equations can then be used to approximate current exploited biomass relative to unexploited biomass. In addition, these parameters allow the estimation of length at ﬁrst capture that would maximize catch and biomass for a given ﬁshing effort, and estimation of a proxy for the relative biomass capable of producing maximum sustainable yields. Relative biomass estimates of LBB were not signiﬁcantly different from the “true” values in simulated data and were similar to independent estimates from full stock assessments. LBB also presents a new indicator for assessing whether an observed size structure is indicative of a healthy stock. LBB results will obviously be misleading if the length frequency data do not represent the size composition of the exploited size range of the stock or if length frequencies resulting from the interplay of growth and mortality are masked by strong recruitment pulses.},

Contrasting regions that have been managed for rebuilding with those that have not, reveals trajectories of decline and recovery from individual stocks to species, communities, and large marine ecosystems.

            After a long history of overexploitation, increasing efforts to restore marine ecosystems and rebuild fisheries are under way. Here, we analyze current trends from a fisheries and conservation perspective. In 5 of 10 well-studied ecosystems, the average exploitation rate has recently declined and is now at or below the rate predicted to achieve maximum sustainable yield for seven systems. Yet 63\% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context. Impacts of international fleets and the lack of alternatives to fishing complicate prospects for rebuilding fisheries in many poorer regions, highlighting the need for a global perspective on rebuilding marine resources.},

There appear to be few significant resources to be developed, and the majority of the world's fish stocks are intensively exploited. Many marine ecosystems have been profoundly changed by fishing and other human activities. Although most of the world's major fisheries continue to produce substantial sustainable yield, a number have been severely overfished, and many more stocks appear to be heading toward depletion. The world's fisheries continue to be heavily subsidized, which encourages overfishing and provides society with a small fraction of the potential economic benefits. In most of the world's fisheries there is a “race for fish” in which boats compete to catch the fish before a quota is achieved or the fish are caught by someone else. The race for fish leads to economic inefficiency, poor quality product, and pressure to extract every fish for short-term gain. A number of countries have instituted alternative management practices that eliminate the race for fish and encourage economic efficiency, use lower exploitation rates that deliberately do not attempt to maximize biological yield, and encourage reduced fishing costs and increased value of products. In fisheries where this transition has taken place, we see the potential for future sustainability, but in those fisheries where the race for fish continues, we anticipate further declines in abundance, further loss of jobs and fishing communities, and potential structural change to marine ecosystems.},

To facilitate new analyses, we developed a new database, the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database, for commercially exploited marine ﬁshes and invertebrates. Time series of total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, ﬁshing mortality and catch/landings form the core of the database. Assessments were assembled from 21 national and international management agencies for a total of 331 stocks (295 ﬁsh stocks representing 46 families and 36 invertebrate stocks representing 12 families), including nine of the world’s 10 largest ﬁsheries. Stock assessments were available from 27 large marine ecosystems, the Caspian Sea and four High Seas regions, and include the Atlantic, Paciﬁc, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Most assessments came from the USA, Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Assessed marine stocks represent a small proportion of harvested ﬁsh taxa (16\%), and an even smaller proportion of marine ﬁsh biodiversity (1\%), but provide high-quality data for intensively studied stocks. The database provides new insight into the status of exploited populations: 58\% of stocks with reference points (n = 214) were estimated to be below the biomass resulting in maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and 30\% had exploitation levels above the exploitation rate resulting in maximum sustainable yield (UMSY). We anticipate that the database will facilitate new research in population dynamics and ﬁshery management, and we encourage further data contributions from stock assessment scientists.},

              Information about the survival of species is important in many ecological applications. Yet, the estimation of a species’ natural mortality rate
              M
              remains a major problem in the management and conservation of wild populations, often circumvented by applying empirical equations that relate mortality to other traits that are more easily observed. We show that mean adult
              M
              can be approximated from the general law of decay if the average maximum age reached by individuals in a cohort is known. This is possible because the proportion
              P
              of individuals surviving to the average maximum age in a cohort is surprisingly similar across a wide range of examined species at 1.5\%. The likely reason for the narrow range of
              P
              is a universal increase in the rate of mortality near the end of life, providing strong evidence that the evolutionary theories of ageing are the norm in natural populations.},

            The gill-oxygen limitation theory (GOLT) provides mechanisms for key aspects of the biology (food conversion efficiency, growth and its response to temperature, the timing of maturation, and others) of water-breathing ectotherms (WBEs). The GOLT’s basic tenet is that the surface area of the gills or other respiratory surfaces of WBE cannot, as two-dimensional structures, supply them with sufficient oxygen to keep up with the growth of their three-dimensional bodies. Thus, a lower relative oxygen supply induces sexual maturation, and later a slowing and cessation of growth, along with an increase of physiological processes relying on glycolytic enzymes and a declining role of oxidative enzymes. Because the “dimensional tension” underlying this argument is widely misunderstood, emphasis is given to a detailed refutation of objections to the GOLT. This theory still needs to be put on a solid quantitative basis, which will occur after the misconceptions surrounding it are put to rest.},

Particular emphasis is put on providing uncertainty estimates of the data-limited assessment. We assess four cod stocks in the North-East Atlantic and compare our estimates of stock status (F/Fmsy) with the ofﬁcial assessments. The estimated stock status of all four cod stocks followed the established stock assessments remarkably well and the ofﬁcial assessments fell well within the uncertainty bounds. The estimation of spawning stock biomass followed the same trends as the ofﬁcial assessment, but not the same levels. We conclude that the data-limited assessment method can be used for stock assessment and that the uncertainty estimates are reliable. Further work is needed to quantify the spawning biomass of the stock.},

This is demonstrated for 12 species by assuming that wing length measurements are an indicator of body size on the intraspecific level, and by arranging the data in the form of a grid of means of wing lengths for sample areas. Maps giving isophenetic lines for wing length indicate gradually increasing size dines northward and westward from Florida in the Hairy Woodpecker (Dendrocopos villosus), Downy Woodpecker (Dendrocopos pubescens), Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata), Carolina Chickadee (Parus carolinensis), White-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna). In each case there is a trend for larger (or longer-winged) birds to extend southward in the Appalachian Mountains and for smaller (or shorter-winged) birds to extend northward in the Mississippi River valley. Maps made by a computer and automatic plotter using contour intervals of 0.5 mm of mean wing length for the Downy Woodpecker, for male White-breasted Nuthatches, and for female Blue Jays show that, in addition to the pattern just mentioned, relatively longer-winged birds extend southward in the interior highlands of Arkansas, and relatively shorter-winged birds extend northward up other river valleys. These subtle relationships between intraspecific size variation and topographic features suggest that the link between the two phenomena may be precise adaptations to even minor climatic gradients. The relationship between these findings and the subspecies concept is discussed.},

This widespread pattern is embodied by two well-established rules: Bergmann’s rule, which describes the association between temperature and body size in natural environments, and the temperature-size rule, which describes reaction norms relating temperature to body size in laboratory experiments. Theory predicts that organisms should grow to be larger in colder environments when growth efﬁciency decreases with increasing environmental temperature. Using data from 97 laboratory experiments, including 58 species of ectotherms, we found little evidence that growth efﬁciency is negatively related to environmental temperature within the thermal range that is relevant to the temperature-size rule. Instead, growth efﬁciency was either positively related or insensitive to environmental temperature in the majority of cases (73 of 89 cases for gross growth efﬁciency and 18 of 24 cases for net growth efﬁciency). Two possibilities merit consideration. First, high temperatures may impose constraints on growth that only arise late during ontogeny; this simple and potentially general explanation is supported by the fact that thermal optima for growth efﬁciency and growth rate decrease as individuals grow. Alternatively, the general explanation for relationships between temperature and body size may not be simple. If the latter view is correct, the best approach might be to generate and test theories that are tailored speciﬁcally to organisms with similar behavior and physiology.},

However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how growth and key processes affecting it, such as consumption and metabolism, depend on both temperature and body mass within species. This limits our ability to inform growth models, link experimental data to observed growth patterns, and advance mechanistic food web models. To examine the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual growth, as well as the link between maximum consumption, metabolism, and body growth, we conducted a systematic review and compiled experimental data on fishes from 52 studies that combined body mass and temperature treatments. By fitting hierarchical models accounting for variation between species, we estimated how maximum consumption and metabolic rate scale jointly with temperature and body mass within species. We found that whole-­organism maximum consumption increases more slowly with body mass than metabolism, and is unimodal over the full temperature range, which leads to the prediction that optimum growth temperatures decline with body size. Using an independent dataset, we confirmed this negative relationship between optimum growth temperature and body size. Small individuals of a given population may, therefore, exhibit increased growth with initial warming, whereas larger conspecifics could be the first to experience negative impacts of warming on growth. These findings help advance mechanistic models of individual growth and food web dynamics and improve our understanding of how climate warming affects the growth and size structure of aquatic ectotherms.},

It is suggested that there is a particular body size at which meiofaunal life-history and feeding traits can be optimised, and another for macrofaunal traits. As size departs in either direction (larger or smaller) from these optima, fewer species of the same size are able to co-exist. The split occurs at 45 gg because many life history and feeding characteristics switch more or less abruptly at about this body size, compromise traits being either non-viable or disadvantageous. Meiofauna and macrofauna therefore comprise two separate evolutionary units each with an internally coherent set of biological characteristics.},

The model predicts (1) the distinctive right-skewed shape of the frequency distribution of logarithms of body sizes among species that is observed in a wide variety of organisms from bacteria to mammals; (2) a taxon-specific optimal body size, which for mammals is approximately 100 g and is supported by data on the body sizes of mammals on islands; and (3) that in each taxon the relationships between such life-history and ecological characteristics as longevity, clutch size, home range size, and population density will change both slope and sign on either side of the optimal size.

            Modelled dietary scenarios often fail to reflect true dietary practice and do not account for variation in the environmental burden of food due to sourcing and production methods. Here we link dietary data from a sample of 55,504 vegans, vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters with food-level data on greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, eutrophication risk and potential biodiversity loss from a review of 570 life-cycle assessments covering more than 38,000 farms in 119 countries. Our results include the variation in food production and sourcing that is observed in the review of life-cycle assessments. All environmental indicators showed a positive association with amounts of animal-based food consumed. Dietary impacts of vegans were 25.1\% (95\% uncertainty interval, 15.1–37.0\%) of high meat-eaters (≥100 g total meat consumed per day) for greenhouse gas emissions, 25.1\% (7.1–44.5\%) for land use, 46.4\% (21.0–81.0\%) for water use, 27.0\% (19.4–40.4\%) for eutrophication and 34.3\% (12.0–65.3\%) for biodiversity. At least 30\% differences were found between low and high meat-eaters for most indicators. Despite substantial variation due to where and how food is produced, the relationship between environmental impact and animal-based food consumption is clear and should prompt the reduction of the latter.},

The often-used harmonic mean approximation (HMA) makes no prior assumptions about the character of the distribution but tends to be inconsistent. The Laplace approximation is stable but makes strong, and often inappropriate, assumptions about the shape of the posterior distribution. Here, I argue that the marginal likelihood can be reliably computed from a posterior sample using Lebesgue integration theory in one of two ways: 1) when the HMA integral exists, compute the measure function numerically and analyze the resulting quadrature to control error; 2) compute the measure function numerically for the marginal likelihood integral itself using a space-partitioning tree, followed by quadrature. The ﬁrst algorithm automatically eliminates the part of the sample that contributes large truncation error in the HMA. Moreover, it provides a simple graphical test for the existence of the HMA integral. The second algorithm uses the posterior sample to assign probability to a partition of the sample space and performs the marginal likelihood integral directly. It uses the posterior sample to discover and tessellate the subset of the sample space that was explored and uses quantiles to compute a representative ﬁeld value. When integrating directly, this space may be trimmed to remove regions with low probability density and thereby improve accuracy. This second algorithm is consistent for all proper distributions. Error analysis provides some diagnostics on the numerical condition of the results in both cases.},

              et al.
              show, however, that one of the most striking and important parts of the reef ecosystem is almost never seen (see the Perspective by Riginos and Leis). Small cryptobenthic fish, like blennies, make up nearly 40\% of reef fish biodiversity. Furthermore, the majority of cryptobenthic fish larvae settle locally, rather than being widely dispersed, and have rapid turnover rates. Such high diversity and densities could thus provide the biomass base for larger, better-known reef fish.

          , 
            How coral reefs survive as oases of life in low-productivity oceans has puzzled scientists for centuries. The answer may lie in internal nutrient cycling and/or input from the pelagic zone. Integrating meta-analysis, field data, and population modeling, we show that the ocean’s smallest vertebrates, cryptobenthic reef fishes, promote internal reef fish biomass production through extensive larval supply from the pelagic environment. Specifically, cryptobenthics account for two-thirds of reef fish larvae in the near-reef pelagic zone despite limited adult reproductive outputs. This overwhelming abundance of cryptobenthic larvae fuels reef trophodynamics via rapid growth and extreme mortality, producing almost 60\% of consumed reef fish biomass. Although cryptobenthics are often overlooked, their distinctive demographic dynamics may make them a cornerstone of ecosystem functioning on modern coral reefs.},

A meta-analysis of published size-specific mortality rates for coral reef fishes revealed an exponential decline in mortality rate with increasing body size, however, within this broad relationship there are three distinct phases. Phase one is characterized by naive fishes recruiting to reefs, which suffer extremely high mortality rates. In this well-studied phase, fishes must learn quickly to survive the many predation risks. After just a few days, the surviving fishes enter phase two, in which small increases in body size result in pronounced increases in lifespan (estimated 11 d mm
              –1
              ). Remarkably, approximately 50\% of reef fish individuals remain in phase two throughout their lives. Once fishes reach a size threshold of about 43 mm total length (TL) they enter phase three, where mortality rates are relatively low and the pressure to grow is presumably, significantly reduced. These phases provide a clearer understanding of the impact of body size on mortality rates in coral reef fishes and begin to reveal critical insights into the energetic and trophic dynamics of coral reefs.},

	abstract = {Teleost ﬁshes are the most diverse group of vertebrates on Earth. On tropical coral reefs, their species richness exceeds 6000 species; one tenth of total vertebrate biodiversity. A large proportion of this diversity is composed of cryptobenthic reef ﬁshes (CRFs): bottom-dwelling, morphologically or behaviourally cryptic species typically less than 50 mm in length. Yet, despite their diversity and abundance, these ﬁshes are both poorly deﬁned and understood. Herein we provide a new quantitative deﬁnition and synthesise current knowledge on the diversity, distribution and life history of CRFs. First, we use size distributions within families to deﬁne 17 core CRF families as characterised by the high prevalence ({\textgreater}10\%) of small-bodied species ({\textless}50 mm). This stands in strong contrast to 42 families of large reef ﬁshes, in which virtually no small-bodied species have evolved. We posit that small body size has allowed CRFs to diversify at extremely high rates, primarily by allowing for ﬁne partitioning of microhabitats and facilitation of allopatric reproductive isolation; yet, we are far from understanding and documenting the biodiversity of CRFs. Using rates of description since 1758, we predict that approximately 30 new species of cryptobenthic species will be described per year until 2050 (approximately twice the annual rate compared to large ﬁshes). Furthermore, we predict that by the year 2031, more than half of the described coral reef ﬁsh biodiversity will consist of CRFs. These ﬁshes are the ‘hidden half’ of vertebrate biodiversity on coral reefs. Notably, global geographic coverage and spatial resolution of quantitative data on CRF communities is uniformly poor, which further emphasises the remarkable reservoir of biodiversity that is yet to be discovered. Although small body size may have enabled extensive diversiﬁcation within CRF families, small size also comes with a suite of ecological challenges that affect ﬁshes’ capacities to feed, survive and reproduce; we identify a range of life-history adaptations that have enabled CRFs to overcome these limitations. In turn, these adaptations bestow a unique socio-ecological role on CRFs, which includes a key role in coral reef trophodynamics by cycling trophic energy provided by microscopic prey to larger consumers. Although small in body size, the ecology and evolutionary history of CRFs may make them a critical component of coral-reef food webs; yet our review also shows that these ﬁshes are highly susceptible to a variety of anthropogenic disturbances. Understanding the consequences of these changes for CRFs and coral reef ecosystems will require us to shed more light on this frequently overlooked but highly diverse and abundant guild of coral reef ﬁshes.},

On the basis of this tenet, we developed and tested a new theory that predicts the relationships among three fundamental aspects of life: metabolic rate, growth, and reproduction. We show that the optimization of these processes yields the observed allometries of metazoan life, particularly metabolic scaling. We conclude that metabolism, growth, and reproduction are inextricably linked; that together they determine fitness; and, in contrast to longstanding dogma, that no single component drives another. Our model predicts that anthropogenic change will cause animals to evolve decreased scaling exponents of metabolism, increased growth rates, and reduced lifetime reproductive outputs, with worrying consequences for the replenishment of future populations.

We analyse size spectra with co-located ﬁsh and mobile macroinvertebrate data from 3369 reef sites worldwide, speciﬁcally focusing on how the addition of invertebrate data alters patterns. The inclusion of invertebrates steepens the size spectrum, more so in temperate regions, resulting in a consistent size spectrum slope across latitudes, and bringing slopes closer to theoretical expectations based on energy ﬂow through the system. These results highlight the importance of understanding contributions of both invertebrates and ﬁshes to reef food webs worldwide.},

	abstract = {The study of the distribution of biomass by size provides an ataxonomic approach for analyzing the structure of the pelagic ecosystem. However, empirical data regarding planktonic size-structure in offshore areas are scarce. Here, we report the results of a study of the planktonic biomass size-distribution at several stations located within two regions (Sargasso Sea and New England Seamounts Area) of the Northwest Atlantic. The biomass size-spectra covered a bodysize range from bacteria to mesozooplankton and a depth range from the surface to 400 m. It is shown that the slope of the normalized biomass size-spectrum (NBS-spectrum) varies depending on whether volume or carbon units are used. The transformation from volume to carbon units makes the slope of the NBS-spectrum approximately 0.15 units more negative. The distribution of normalized-biomass by size was linear (plotted on a log–log scale) at all stations. The slopes of the NBS-spectra (volume scale) ranged from Ϫ0.96 to Ϫ1.01. There were no signiﬁcant differences among the slopes of the NBS-spectra within either of the two areas studied. In addition, no signiﬁcant differences were detected between the stations in the Sargasso Sea and those located in the New England Seamounts area. Apart from a tendency towards a decrease in the intercept of the normalized-biomass axis of the size-spectra in deeper waters, the NBS-spectra were also very similar through depth. The slopes of the NBS-spectra in biovolume units are not signiﬁcantly different from Ϫ1.0 (p Ͻ 0.01), and therefore are in agreement with Sheldon’s Linear Biomass Hypothesis. By contrast, the slopes of the NBS-spectra in carbon units are signiﬁcantly different (p Ͻ 0.01) from Ϫ1.0 (range = –1.09 to –1.17; all stations together = –1.14) and their numerical values are in close agreement with Platt and Denman’s model and with the ﬁndings of Rodr´ıguez and Mullin, 1986a) for the North Paciﬁc Central Gyre. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the planktonic size-structure of offshore oligotrophic systems is a conservative property.  2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Plankton size spectra are an effective approach of summarising the size structure of the community and have the potential to indicate the transfer of energy up the trophic food web. However, data on which open ocean plankton biomass-size structure can be constructed are scarce. Here we present the latitudinal distribution in the Atlantic Ocean of normalised biomass-size spectra (NB-S), plankton biomass and abundance, as well as mean zooplankton size between 701N and 501S. Samples were collected from three Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruises during May/June 2003, September/October 2003 and April/June 2004, as well as from a Marine Productivity (MarProd) cruise farther north in the Irminger Sea during spring 2002. The biomass-size distribution covered a body size range from nano- to mesoplankton and was based on a depth range of 50–0 m on the AMT and 120–0 m on the Irminger Sea cruise. The distribution of normalised biomass versus size was linear on a double log plot at all of the 95 stations. The slopes of the NB-S spectra ranged from À0.93 to À1.26 and À1.12 to À1.46 on the AMT and Irminger Sea cruises, respectively. A ‘‘dome-shaped’’ pattern in the slopes of community size spectra was observed in the Atlantic, indicating a decrease in the trophic transfer efﬁciency of energy with increasing latitude and phytoplankton biomass. Mesozooplankton biomass, abundance, and mean size followed a distribution similar to ecosystem productivity.},

Given the complexity of near misses, seeking regularities in time series of near misses is almost impossible. We present a human dynamics model based on near-miss data to reveal common dynamic features of near-miss accidents that result from unsafe behavior of construction workers. To validate the model, we conducted an empirical case study based on unsafe behavior related to near misses from a database in the Early Warning System for Safety Risk Management in Wuhan Metro Construction, created by the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Heavy-tailed distribution and approximate power-law distribution are observed in the inter-event time series of near misses, rather than being randomly distributed in time in current models. The strong burst and weak memory phenomena were observed in the whole, annual, and categorized inter-event time distributions of near misses. Moreover, the results showed a non-trivial, monotonous increase of the power-law exponent with the activity of different construction site in near misses, thus indicating that heterogeneity and complexity exist in general. We defined a new safety performance metric that is more reliable than the number of near misses and validated this performance metric by using expert assessment results of metro construction sites. Furthermore, we proposed further research prospects on human dynamics in construction safety behavior.},

Using a database of phytoplankton abundance, species composition and cell size from coastal, shelf and open-ocean environments, we show that the biogeographical patterns of phytoplankton size distribution in the ocean are a result of systematic changes in the relationship between species richness and cell size. Our results indicate that, regardless of the environmental conditions, population abundance decreases consistently to the –3/4 power of cell size. By contrast, marine phytoplankton diversity peaks at small sizes in oligotrophic waters but is either a log-normal function or independent of cell size in eutrophic systems. It is argued that, operating on evolutionary time scales, size-dependent biophysical constraints for resource acquisition are reflected in the size distribution of species richness and consequently in the size structure of phytoplankton communities in the ocean. These findings indicate that the way in which biological diversity changes with body size is crucial to a better understanding of the structure and functioning of microbial plankton communities and how energy flows through pelagic ecosystems.},

The results indicate that the relative contributions of three size classes based upon the pico-, nano-, and microplankton size range exhibit substantial changes among measures of particle size and between oceanic environments. The single-slope power law model commonly employed to characterize the PSD in aquatic studies is demonstrated to have significant limitations in capturing the complexity of PSD shapes observed for natural particle assemblages, and in consequence poorly predicts the relative contributions of these different size intervals. We show that specific percentile diameters derived from the cumulative distributions of particle size are strongly correlated with the contributions of these three size classes, and that these non-parametric descriptors of the cumulative distribution provide superior performance for estimating their contributions while requiring no assumption of underlying PSD shape. A comparison of these predictive relationships with independent field measurements suggests that this approach is generally robust for particle assemblages representing a wide diversity of marine environments.},

            Global patterns of planktonic diversity are mainly determined by the dispersal of propagules with ocean currents. However, the role that abundance and body size play in determining spatial patterns of diversity remains unclear. Here we analyse spatial community structure - β-diversity - for several planktonic and nektonic organisms from prokaryotes to small mesopelagic fishes collected during the Malaspina 2010 Expedition. β-diversity was compared to surface ocean transit times derived from a global circulation model, revealing a significant negative relationship that is stronger than environmental differences. Estimated dispersal scales for different groups show a negative correlation with body size, where less abundant large-bodied communities have significantly shorter dispersal scales and larger species spatial turnover rates than more abundant small-bodied plankton. Our results confirm that the dispersal scale of planktonic and micro-nektonic organisms is determined by local abundance, which scales with body size, ultimately setting global spatial patterns of diversity.},

However, not all of these become successful in their new environments. Success here is deﬁned by wide geographical spread, increased abundances, and larger maximum sizes than their native range. The silver-cheeked toadﬁsh Lagocephalus sceleratus (Gmelin 1789) was ﬁrst recorded in the Mediterranean Sea in 2003. It has now spread to all corners of the basin and is increasingly abundant in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea where it reaches monstrous sizes compared to the maximum sizes reported from its native range. This contribution presents three well-documented new weight records from the Dodecanese Islands, Greece: one specimen weighing 8.5 kg from 2012, and two specimens weighing 8 and 9 kg, respectively, from 2021. The latter is also conﬁrmed with other well-documented larger-size records, along with a physiological hypothesis suggesting how such large sizes are reached.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics.},

While agespeciﬁc mortality is considered to be the main determinant of the optimal allocation, some life-history strategies, such as delayed or skipped reproduction, may be better understood when also accounting for reproduction costs. Here, we present a two-pool indeterminate grower model that includes survival and energetic costs of reproduction. The energetic cost sets a minimum reserve required for reproduction, while the survival cost reﬂects increased mortality from low postreproductive body condition. Three life-history parameters determining agedependent energy allocation to soma, reserve, and reproduction are optimized, and we show that the optimal strategies can reproduce realistic emergent growth trajectories, maturation ages, and reproductive outputs for ﬁsh. The model predicts maturation phase shifts along the gradient of condition-related mortality and shows that increased harvesting will select for earlier maturation and higher energy allocation to reproduction. However, since the energetic reproduction cost sets limits on how early an individual can mature, an increase in ﬁtness at high harvesting can only be achieved by diverting most reserves into reproduction. The model presented here can improve predictions of life-history responses to environmental change and human impacts because key life-history traits such as maturation age and size, maximum body size, and size-speciﬁc fecundity emerge dynamically.},

Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) have experienced widespread declines in mean age and size throughout their North American range. We investigated the consequences of declines in body size for spawner reproductive potential in terms of total egg mass per female. Our case study is the Yukon River where Chinook salmon have supported subsistence, commercial, and recreational ﬁsheries. Using historical observations on individual body size from throughout the Yukon River and the relationship between female size and total egg mass from the Canadian portion, we estimate a decline in average female reproductive potential of 24\%–35\% since the 1970s. Because spawner abundances and the population sex ratio have not shown clear trends over time, our results suggest a reduced total population reproductive potential. Changes in spawner quality should be considered when developing management reference points, and conservation of population demographic structure may be necessary to sustain productive Chinook salmon systems.},

The implication made is that current theory and practice severely underestimate the importance of larger females for population replenishment.

	abstract = {The natural mortality of exploited ﬁsh populations is often assumed to be a speciesspeciﬁc constant independent of body size. This assumption has important implications for size-based ﬁsh population models and for predicting the outcome of sizedependent ﬁsheries management measures such as mesh-size regulations. To test the assumption, we critically review the empirical estimates of the natural mortality, M (year)1), of marine and brackish water ﬁsh stocks and model them as a function of von Bertalanffy growth parameters, L¥ (cm) and K (year)1), temperature (Kelvin) and length, L (cm). Using the Arrhenius equation to describe the relationship between M and temperature, we ﬁnd M to be signiﬁcantly related to length, L¥ and K, but not to temperature (R2 = 0.62, P {\textless} 0.0001, n = 168). Temperature and K are significantly correlated and when K is removed from the model the temperature term becomes signiﬁcant, but the resulting model explains less of the total variance (R2 = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.0001, n = 168). The relationships between M, L, L¥, K and temperature are shown to be in general accordance with previous theoretical and empirical investigations. We conclude that natural mortality is signiﬁcantly related to length and growth characteristics and recommend to use the empirical formula: ln(M) = 0.55 ) 1.61ln(L) + 1.44ln(L¥) + ln(K), for estimating the natural mortality of marine and brackish water ﬁsh.},

	abstract = {We synthesise traditional unstructured food webs, allometric body size scaling, trait-based modelling, and physiologically structured modelling to provide a novel and ecologically relevant tool for sizestructured food webs. The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population structure of each species as a sizespectrum. Each species is characterised by the trait ‘size at maturation’, and all model parameters are made species independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of ﬁsh communities as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on biomass distribution as a function of individual size, biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and relation between predator–prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size at maturation.},

            Early warning signals (EWSs) offer the hope that patterns observed in data can predict the future states of ecological systems. While a large body of research identifies such signals prior to the collapse of populations, the prediction that such signals should also be present before a system’s recovery has thus far been overlooked. We assess whether EWSs are present prior to the recovery of overexploited marine systems using a trait-based ecological model and analysis of real-world fisheries data. We show that both abundance and trait-based signals are independently detectable prior to the recovery of stocks, but that combining these two signals provides the best predictions of recovery. This work suggests that the efficacy of conservation interventions aimed at restoring systems which have collapsed may be predicted prior to the recovery of the system, with direct relevance for conservation planning and policy.},

However, mixed empirical evidence has led to a controversy about the mechanisms affecting species’ size and performance under different temperatures.

	abstract = {Most ectothermic organisms mature at smaller body sizes when reared in warmer conditions. This phenotypically plastic response, known as the “temperature-size rule” (TSR), is one of the most taxonomically widespread patterns in biology. However, the TSR remains a longstanding life-history puzzle for which no dominant driver has been found. We propose that oxygen supply plays a central role in explaining the magnitude of ectothermic temperature-size responses. Given the much lower oxygen availability and greater effort required to increase uptake in water vs. air, we predict that the TSR in aquatic organisms, especially larger species with lower surface area–body mass ratios, will be stronger than in terrestrial organisms. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,890 body mass responses to temperature in controlled experiments on 169 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species. This reveals that the strength of the temperature-size response is greater in aquatic than terrestrial species. In animal species of ∼100 mg dry mass, the temperature-size response of aquatic organisms is 10 times greater than in terrestrial organisms (−5.0\% °C
              −1
              vs. −0.5\% °C
              −1
              ). Moreover, although the size response of small ({\textless}0.1 mg dry mass) aquatic and terrestrial species is similar, increases in species size cause the response to become increasingly negative in aquatic species, as predicted, but on average less negative in terrestrial species. These results support oxygen as a major driver of temperature-size responses in aquatic organisms. Further, the environment-dependent differences parallel latitudinal body size clines, and will influence predicted impacts of climate warming on food production, community structure, and food-web dynamics.},

These results are in accordance with the ecological rules dealing with the temperature–size relationships (i.e., Bergmann's rule, James' rule and Temperature–Size Rule).

	abstract = {Observations of climate impacts on ecosystems highlight the need for an understanding of organismal thermal ranges and their implications at the ecosystem level. Where changes in aquatic animal populations have been observed, the integrative concept of oxygen- and capacitylimited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) has successfully characterised the onset of thermal limits to performance and field abundance. The OCLTT concept addresses the molecular to whole-animal mechanisms that define thermal constraints on the capacity for oxygen supply to the organism in relation to oxygen demand. The resulting ‘total excess aerobic power budget’ supports an animal’s performance (e.g. comprising motor activity, reproduction and growth) within an individual’s thermal range. The aerobic power budget is often approximated through measurements of aerobic scope for activity (i.e. the maximum difference between resting and the highest exerciseinduced rate of oxygen consumption), whereas most animals in the field rely on lower (i.e. routine) modes of activity. At thermal limits, OCLTT also integrates protective mechanisms that extend time-limited tolerance to temperature extremes – mechanisms such as chaperones, anaerobic metabolism and antioxidative defence. Here, we briefly summarise the OCLTT concept and update it by addressing the role of routine metabolism. We highlight potential pitfalls in applying the concept and discuss the variables measured that led to the development of OCLTT. We propose that OCLTT explains why thermal vulnerability is highest at the whole-animal level and lowest at the molecular level. We also discuss how OCLTT captures the thermal constraints on the evolution of aquatic animal life and supports an understanding of the benefits of transitioning from water to land.},

            The complexity and cost of assessment techniques prohibits their application to 90\% of fisheries. Simple generic approaches are needed for the world's small-scale and data-poor fisheries. This meta-analysis of the relationship between spawning potential and the normalized size and age of 123 marine species suggests that the so-called Beverton–Holt life-history invariants (BH-LHI; Lm/L∞, M/k, M × Agem) actually vary together in relation to life-history strategy, determining the relationship between size, age, and reproductive potential for each species. Although little realized, the common assumption of unique values for the BH-LHI also implies that all species share the same relationship between size, age, and reproductive potential. This implicit assumption is not supported by this meta-analysis, which suggests that there is considerable but predictable natural variation in the BH-LHI ratios and the relationships between size, age, and reproductive potential that they determine. We believe that this reconceptualization of the BH-LHI has potential to provide a theoretical framework for “borrowing” knowledge from well-studied species to apply to related, unstudied species and populations, and when applied together with the assessment technique described by Hordyk et al. (2015b), could make simple forms of size-based assessment possible for many currently unassessable fish stocks.},

Many models have unsuccessfully attempted to reproduce temperature-size rule-consistent life histories by using two-term (anabolism and catabolism) Pütter-type growth models, such as the von Bertalanffy. Here, we present a physiologically structured individual growth model, which incorporates an energy budget and optimizes energy allocation to growth, reproduction, and reserves. Growth, maturation, and reproductive output emerge as a result of life-history optimization to speciﬁc physiological rates and mortality conditions. To assess which processes can lead to temperature-size rule-type life histories, we simulate 42 scenarios that differ in temperature and body size dependencies of intake, metabolism, and mortality rates. Results show that the temperature-size rule can emerge in two ways. The ﬁrst way requires both intake and metabolism to increase with temperature, but the temperature-body size interaction of the two rates must lead to relatively faster intake increase in small individuals and relatively larger metabolism increase in large ones. The second way requires only higher temperature-driven natural mortality and faster intake rates in early life (no change in metabolic rates is needed). This selects for faster life histories with earlier maturation and increased reproductive output. Our model provides a novel mechanistic and evolutionary framework for identifying the conditions necessary for the temperature-size rule. It shows that the temperature-size rule is likely to reﬂect both physiological changes and life-history optimization and that use of von Bertalanffy-type models, which do not include reproduction processes, can hinder our ability to understand and predict ectotherm responses to climate change.},

Insufﬁcient systematic broadscale monitoring limits our understanding of the true extent of these impacts and our capacity to track these at scales relevant to national policies and international agreements. Using an extensive time series of co-located reef ﬁsh community structure and habitat data spanning 12 years and the entire Australian continent, we found that reef ﬁsh community responses to changing temperatures and habitats are dynamic and widespread but regionally patchy. Shifts in composition and abundance of the ﬁsh community often occurred within 2 years of environmental or habitat change, although the relative importance of these two mechanisms of climate impact tended to differ between tropical and temperate zones. The clearest of these changes on temperate and subtropical reefs were temperature related, with responses measured by the reef ﬁsh thermal index indicating reshufﬂing according to the thermal afﬁnities of species present. On low latitude coral reefs, the community generalization index indicated shifting dominance of habitat generalist ﬁshes through time, concurrent with changing coral cover. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining local ecological detail when scaling up datasets to inform national policies and global biodiversity targets. Scaled-up ecological monitoring is needed to discriminate among increasingly diverse drivers of large-scale biodiversity change and better connect presently disjointed systems of biodiversity observation, indicator research, and governance.},

	abstract = {Matrix population models require the population to be divided into discrete stage classes. In many cases, especially when classes are defined by a continuous variable, such as length or mass, there are no natural breakpoints, and the division is artificial. We introduce the "integral projection model," which eliminates the need for division into discrete classes, without requiring any additional biological assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model yields smooth curves for each of these as a function of individual size. We describe a method for fitting the model to data, and we apply this method to data on an endangered plant species, northern monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense), with individuals classified by stem diameter. The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, but the reproductive values and sensitivities in the matrix model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes. The integral projection model avoids this problem and yields size-specific sensitivities that are not affected by stage duration. These general properties of the integral projection model will make it advantageous for other populations where there is no natural division of individuals into stage classes.},

The distributions at depth do not appear to arise from settling of particles from the surface; one possible reason is that particle formation takes place in situ. It is shown that particles will form in undisturbed membrane-filtered seawater under a variety of conditions and that this phenomenon occurred in the presence of bacteria. Particles larger than 1.58 ,u could only be produced to certain limiting concentrations, usually less than 1 ppm by volume, and the final concentration formed depended on the origin of the water. If the particles were filtered from the water, another period of particle formation would occur. The possible importance of these particles in the marine economy is discussed with particular reference to filter feeders.},

These changes in components of the Earth’s biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in inﬂuencing ecosystem properties.

	abstract = {We compiled 46 broadscale data sets of species richness for a wide range of terrestrial plant, invertebrate, and ectothermic vertebrate groups in all parts of the world to test the ability of metabolic theory to account for observed diversity gradients. The theory makes two related predictions: (1) ln-transformed richness is linearly associated with a linear, inverse transformation of annual temperature, and (2) the slope of the relationship is near À0.65. Of the 46 data sets, 14 had no signiﬁcant relationship; of the remaining 32, nine were linear, meeting prediction 1. Model I (ordinary least squares, OLS) and model II (reduced major axis, RMA) regressions then tested the linear slopes against prediction 2. In the 23 data sets having nonlinear relationships between richness and temperature, split-line regression divided the data into linear components, and regressions were done on each component to test prediction 2 for subsets of the data. Of the 46 data sets analyzed in their entirety using OLS regression, one was consistent with metabolic theory (meeting both predictions), and one was possibly consistent. Using RMA regression, no data sets were consistent. Of 67 analyses of prediction 2 using OLS regression on all linear data sets and subsets, two were consistent with the prediction, and four were possibly consistent. Using RMA regression, one was consistent (albeit weakly), and four were possibly consistent. We also found that the relationship between richness and temperature is both taxonomically and geographically conditional, and there is no evidence for a universal response of diversity to temperature. Meta-analyses conﬁrmed signiﬁcant heterogeneity in slopes among data sets, and the combined slopes across studies were signiﬁcantly lower than the range of slopes predicted by metabolic theory based on both OLS and RMA regressions. We conclude that metabolic theory, as currently formulated, is a poor predictor of observed diversity gradients in most terrestrial systems.},

	abstract = {Studies of lake ecosystems generally focus on pelagic food chains and processes. Recently, there has been an emerging recognition of the importance of benthic production and processes to whole-lake ecosystems. To examine the extent to which zoobenthos contribute to higher trophic level production in lakes, we synthesized diet data from 470 fish populations (15 species) and stable isotope data from 90 fish populations (11 species), all of which are common inhabitants of north-temperate lakes. Across all species considered, zoobenthos averaged 50\% of total prey consumption. Indirect consumption of zoobenthos (i.e., feeding on zoobenthos-supported fishes) contributed another 15\%, for a total of 65\% reliance on benthic secondary production. Stable isotopes provided estimates of mean zoobenthivory ranging from 43\% to 59\%. For most fish species, consumption of zoobenthos was highly variable among populations. The overwhelming concern of ecologists with pelagic food chains and processes contrasts sharply with our finding that benthic secondary production plays a central role in supporting higher trophic level production. This extensive zoobenthivory can subsidize fish populations, leading to apparent competition and otherwise altering trophic dynamics and ecosystem processes in the pelagic zone. We argue for a more integrated view of lake ecosystems that recognizes the duality of benthic and pelagic production pathways. Food web models that explicitly consider energy flow from pelagic and benthic sources will provide a more realistic energy flow template for understanding the regulation of lake ecosystem functioning.},

In response, ecological indicators have been developed to assess the state of reef ﬁsheries and their broader ecosystem-level impacts. To date, use of ﬁsheries indicators for coral reefs has been rather piecemeal, with no overarching understanding of their performance with respect to highlighting ﬁshing effects. Here, we provide a review of multispecies ﬁshery-independent indicators used to evaluate ﬁshing impacts on coral reefs. We investigate the consistency with which indicators highlight ﬁshing effects on coral reefs. We then address questions of statistical power and uncertainty, type of ﬁshing gradient, scale of analysis, the inﬂuence of other variables and the need for more work to set reference points for empirical, ﬁsheries-independent indicators on coral reefs. Our review provides knowledge that will help underpin the assessment of the ecological effects of ﬁshing, offering essential support for the development and implementation of coral reef ﬁsheries management plans.},

	abstract = {The marine benthic algae of Norfolk Island are documented and 60 of the 236 species are illustrated. All records are fully referenced, and type localities, local distribution and notes on taxonomic and biogeographic affinities of each species are given. Of the 236 taxa, 41 species are Chlorophyta, 41 are Phaeophyta and the remainder (154) are Rhodophyta. Apart from several undescribed taxa, none is endemic to the island, although Solieria anastomosa and Dasya fruticulosa are apparently restricted to Norfolk and Lord Howe Island, the two islands presently sharing 106 species (almost half the Norfolk marine flora and one-third that of Lord Howe). Although there are some species for which Norfolk Island represents a major range extension into or within the Pacific (Dasycladus ramosus, Halicoryne wrightii, Anotrichium anthericephalum, Herposiphonia arcuata and Polysiphonia japonica), a considerable number of the species are shared with the Great Barrier Reef and the New South Wales coastline as well as Lord Howe Island. Major northern range extensions are recorded for the large temperate brown alga Ecklonia radiata, and possibly Phyllospora comosa and Durvillaea antarctica, although the island more typically hosts numerous tropical algae such as Trichogloea requienii and members of the green algal order Dasycladales including Halicoryne wrightii, Bornetella nitida and Neomeris annulata. As a consequence of this survey, the two rhodymeniacean species Chrysymenia ornata and C. digitata are considered to be conspecific.},

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years, it has become increasingly clear that coral reefs are some of the most threatened ecosystems in the world. It is now generally accepted that humans impact reefs in a variety of ways, ranging from fishing and land development to anthropogenic climate change, and current research has begun to examine the intricacies of the relationships between anthropogenic factors and coral reef health. This paper describes current research to develop human dimensions data that can be synthesized with coral reef biophysical data to measure human impacts on coral reefs throughout the U.S. Pacific. Some of the challenges inherent in this research are how to characterize and compare coral reef fisheries across the region using the small amount of available fisheries data while taking into consideration the larger social, political, and historical context in which these fisheries are embedded. While it is important to understand the overarching trends and commonalities across coral reef fisheries so that management strategies can address conservation concerns in a consistent manner, we need to be able to advise managers on ways to incorporate knowledge of local human interactions with coral reef ecosystems and involve the institutions that manage them at a local scale.},

Data from 14 temperate and subtropical Australian MPAs further demonstrated that ecological changes continue to develop in MPAs over at least two decades, probably much longer. The continent-scale study additionally showed recently established MPAs to be consistently located at sites with low resource value relative to adjacent ﬁshed reference areas. This outcome was presumably generated by sociopolitical pressures and planning processes that aim to systematically avoid locations with valuable resources, potentially compromising biodiversity conservation goals. Locations that were formerly highly ﬁshed are needed within MPA networks if the networks are to achieve conservation aims associated with (1) safeguarding all regional habitat types, (2) protecting threatened habitats and species, and (3) providing appropriate reference benchmarks for assessing impacts of ﬁshing. Because of long time lags, the ubiquity of ﬁshing impacts, and the relatively recent establishment of MPAs, the full impact of ﬁshing on coastal reefs has yet to be empirically assessed.},

	abstract = {Carrying capacities of grazed habitats are typically expressed as numbers or biomass of animals per unit area; however, such parameters are appropriate only when the body size of animals is constant because consumption and other metabolic-rate based parameters such as respiration and production are proportional to body mass raised by a power of {\textasciitilde}0.75 rather than 0 or 1. Habitat carrying levels are therefore better expressed in the form of an index of total community consumption by summing the body masses of individual animals after they have been scaled using a biomass exponent of {\textasciitilde}0.75. A parameter scaled in this way, P20, varied in a predictable manner when calculated for the mobile epifaunal assemblages associated with rope fibre habitats placed at marine and estuarine sites; P2o showed no significant difference between 17 shallow, clear-water sites worldwide, but declined consistently when photosynthesis was reduced. P2o also did not vary significantly when calculated for the mobile epifaunal communities associated with four Amphibolis antarctica seagrass habitats in Australia (Y = 100 gg. g - 1 . day-l), and reached but did not significantly exceed a ceiling of 280 gg 9g-{\textasciitilde} 9day-{\textasciitilde} for Sargassum plants. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the production of shallow-water epifaunal communities of grazers is constrained by resource ceilings which can be quantified using metabolic-rate based indices. If this "production ceiling" hypothesis is correct then diffuse competition is generally more important than predation or environmental disturbance in restricting the growth of mobile epifaunal populations.},

	abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q ¼ 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q . 0) and present a uniﬁed approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and samplebased (incidence) data. Using this uniﬁed sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the ﬁrst three Hill numbers: q ¼ 0 (species richness), q ¼ 1 (the exponential of Shannon’s entropy index), and q ¼ 2 (the inverse of Simpson’s concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing conﬁdence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rareﬁed and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

	abstract = {Ocean warming under climate change threatens coral reefs directly, through fatal heat stress to corals and indirectly, by boosting the energy of cyclones that cause coral destruction and loss of associated organisms. Although cyclone frequency is unlikely to rise, cyclone intensity is predicted to increase globally, causing more frequent occurrences of the most destructive cyclones with potentially severe consequences for coral reef ecosystems. While increasing heat stress is considered a pervasive risk to coral reefs, quantitative estimates of threats from cyclone intensiﬁcation are lacking due to limited data on cyclone impacts to inform projections. Here, using extensive data from Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR), we show that increases in cyclone intensity predicted for this century are sufﬁcient to greatly accelerate coral reef degradation. Coral losses on the outer GBR were small, localized and offset by gains on undisturbed reefs for more than a decade, despite numerous cyclones and periods of record heat stress, until three unusually intense cyclones over 5 years drove coral cover to record lows over {\textgreater}1500 km. Ecological damage was particularly severe in the central-southern region where 68\% of coral cover was destroyed over {\textgreater}1000 km, forcing record declines in the species richness and abundance of associated ﬁsh communities, with many local extirpations. Four years later, recovery of average coral cover was relatively slow and there were further declines in ﬁsh species richness and abundance. Slow recovery of community diversity appears likely from such a degraded starting point. Highly unusual characteristics of two of the cyclones, aside from high intensity, inﬂated the extent of severe ecological damage that would more typically have occurred over 100s of km. Modelling published predictions of future cyclone activity, the likelihood of more intense cyclones within time frames of coral recovery by mid-century poses a global threat to coral reefs and dependent societies.},

In this study, water quality, physical habitats and geographical distance were assessed as potential predictors for the diversity and structure of fish assemblages. Coastal reef fish assemblages of rocky habitats were monitored at different spatial scales in the bays of two populated islands. Differences in the structure of fish assemblages between both islands were driven by temperature and nutrient concentrations. Presence of anthropogenic pressures caused the fish assemblages to be more affected by water conditions than physical habitats while the contrary was true for more pristine areas. Most fish species are able to reach the islands of the archipelago, but temperature gradients and elevated nutrient levels cause large differences in the structure of local fish assemblages. In addition, nutrient concentrations were negatively correlated with alpha diversity. Since pollution is a clear pressure on the fish assemblages of the Galapagos archipelago, environmental management of the coastal areas is of paramount importance.},

	abstract = {Zooplankton are relatively small in size in the subtropical regions. This characteristic has been attributed to intense predation pressure, high nutrient loading and cyanobacterial biomass. To provide further information on the effect of predation and cyanobacteria on zooplankton size structure, we analyzed data from 96 shallow aquaculture lakes along the Yangtze River. Contrary to former studies, both principal components analysis and multiple regression analysis showed that the mean zooplankton size was positively related to fish yield. The studied lakes were grouped into three types, namely, natural fishing lakes with low nutrient loading (Type1), planktivorous fish-dominated lakes (Type 2), and eutrophic lakes with high cyanobacterial biomass (Type 3). A marked difference in zooplankton size structure was found among these groups. The greatest mean zooplankton size was observed in Type 2 lakes, but zooplankton density was the lowest. Zooplankton abundance was highest in Type 3 lakes and increased with increasing cyanobacterial biomass. Zooplankton mean size was negatively correlated with cyanobacterial biomass. No obvious trends were found in Type 1 lakes. These results were reflected by the normalized biomass size spectrum, which showed a unimodal shape with a peak at medium sizes in Type 2 lakes and a peak at small sizes in Type 3 lakes. These results indicated a relative increase in medium-sized and small-sized species in Types 2 and 3 lakes, respectively. Our results suggested that fish predation might have a negative effect on zooplankton abundance but a positive effect on zooplankton size structure. High cyanobacterial biomass most likely caused a decline in the zooplankton size and encouraged the proliferation of small zooplankton. We suggest that both planktivorous fish and cyanobacteria have substantial effects on the shaping of zooplankton community, particularly in the lakes in the eastern plain along the Yangtze River where aquaculture is widespread and nutrient loading is high.},

The developed model uses a series of simple body size power functions to describe the basic processes of predator–prey interactions, reproduction, metabolism, and non-predation mortality based on the principle of mass balance. Linear size spectra with slopes of approximately –1 are successfully reproduced by this model. Several examples of numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the model’s behavior. Size spectra with cut-offs and/or waves are also found for certain parameter values. The matrix model is flexible and can be freely manipulated by users to answer different questions and is executed over a shorter numerical calculation running time than continuous models.},

We analyzed local experiments, long-term regional time series, and global fisheries data to test how biodiversity loss affects marine ecosystem services across temporal and spatial scales. Overall, rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential, stability, and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21\%, on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations.

Diversity was positively correlated with thermal fronts and dissolved oxygen and a nonlinear function of temperature (∼25°C optimum). Diversity declined between 10 and 50\% in all oceans, a trend that coincided with increased fishing pressure, superimposed on strong El Niño–Southern Oscillation–driven variability across the Pacific.

	abstract = {The study of food webs has been a central theme within ecology for decades, and their structure and dynamics have been used to assess a range of key properties of communities (e.g. complexity–stability relationships) and ecosystems (e.g. ﬂuxes of energy and nutrients). However, many food web parameters are sensitive to sampling effort, which is rarely considered, and further, most studies have used either species- or size-averaged data for both nodes and links, rather than individual-based data, which is the level of organisation at which trophic interactions occur. This practice of aggregating data hides a considerable amount of biologically meaningful variation and could, together with potential sampling effects, create methodological artefacts. New individual-based approaches could improve our understanding of, and ability to predict, food web structure and dynamics, particularly if they are derived from simple metabolic and foraging constraints. We explored the effect of species-averaging in four highly-resolved individual-based aquatic food webs (Broadstone Stream, the Afon Hirnant, Tadnoll Brook and the Celtic Sea) and found that it obscured structural regularities resulting from intraspeciﬁc size variation. The individual-based approach provided clearer insights into seasonal and ontogenetic shifts, highlighting the importance of the temporal component of size-structuring in ecological networks. An extension of the Allometric Diet Breadth Model predicted the structure of the empirical food webs almost twice as accurately as the equivalent species-based webs, with the best-ﬁtting model predicting 83\% of the links correctly in the Broadstone Stream size-based web, and the few mismatches between the model and data were explained largely by sampling effects. Our results highlight the need for theoretical explanations to correspond closely with methods of data collection and aggregation, which is the exception rather than the rule at present. We suggest how this situation can be improved by including individual-level data and more explicit information on sampling effort when constructing food webs in future studies.},

	abstract = {Overﬁshing and habitat degradation through climate change pose the greatest threats to sustainability of marine resources on coral reefs. We examined how changes in ﬁshing pressure and benthic habitat composition inﬂuenced the size spectra of island-scale reef ﬁsh communities in Lau, Fiji. Between 2000 and 2006 ﬁshing pressure declined in the Lau Islands due to declining human populations and reduced demand for fresh ﬁsh. At the same time, coral cover declined and ﬁne-scale architectural complexity eroded due to coral bleaching and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starﬁsh, Acanthaster planci. We examined the size distribution of reef ﬁsh communities using size spectra analysis, the linearized relationship between abundance and body size class. Spatial variation in ﬁshing pressure accounted for 31\% of the variation in the slope of the size spectra in 2000, higher ﬁshing pressure being associated with a steeper slope, which is indicative of fewer large-bodied ﬁsh and/or more small-bodied ﬁsh. Conversely, in 2006 spatial variation in habitat explained 53\% of the variation in the size spectra slopes, and the relationship with ﬁshing pressure was much weaker (;12\% of variation) than in 2000. Reduced cover of corals and lower structural complexity was associated with less steep size spectra slopes, primarily due to reduced abundance of ﬁsh ,20 cm. Habitat degradation will compound effects of ﬁshing on coral reefs as increased ﬁshing reduces large-bodied target species, while habitat loss results in fewer small-bodied juveniles and prey that replenish stocks and provide dietary resources for predatory target species. Effective management of reef resources therefore depends on both reducing ﬁshing pressure and maintaining processes that encourage rapid recovery of coral habitat.},

	abstract = {Summary Life is the most complex physical phenomenon in the Universe, manifesting an extraordinary diversity of form and function over an enormous scale from the largest animals and plants to the smallest microbes and subcellular units. Despite this many of its most fundamental and complex phenomena scale with size in a surprisingly simple fashion. For example, metabolic rate scales as the 3/4-power of mass over 27 orders of magnitude, from molecular and intracellular levels up to the largest organisms. Similarly, time-scales (such as lifespans and growth rates) and sizes (such as bacterial genome lengths, tree heights and mitochondrial densities) scale with exponents that are typically simple powers of 1/4. The universality and simplicity of these relationships suggest that fundamental universal principles underly much of the coarse-grained generic structure and organisation of living systems. We have proposed a set of principles based on the observation that almost all life is sustained by hierarchical branching networks, which we assume have invariant terminal units, are space-ﬁlling and are optimised by the process of natural selection. We show how these general constraints explain quarter power scaling and lead to a quantitative, predictive theory that captures many of the essential features of diverse biological systems. Examples considered include animal circulatory systems, plant vascular systems, growth, mitochondrial densities, and the concept of a universal molecular clock. Temperature considerations, dimensionality and the role of invariants are discussed. Criticisms and controversies associated with this approach are also addressed.},

	abstract = {Background: Increasingly, underwater visual censuses (UVC) are used to assess fish populations. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities (.100,000 individuals?km22) and biomasses (.4 tonnes?ha21) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic biomass pyramids. However, few studies have critically evaluated the methods used for sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying noninstantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks.
Conclusions/Significance: Based on our results, we urge that published literature state explicitly whether instantaneous counts were made and that survey procedures be accounted for when non-instantaneous counts are used. Using published density and biomass values of communities that include sharks we explore the effect of this bias and suggest that further investigation may be needed to determine pristine shark abundances and the existence of inverted biomass pyramids. Because such studies are used to make important management and conservation decisions, incorrect estimates of animal abundance and biomass have serious and significant implications.},

            Ecosim models have been fitted to time-series data for a wide variety of ecosystems for which there are long-term data that confirm the models' ability to reproduce past responses of many species to harvesting. We subject these model ecosystems to a variety of harvest policies, including options based on harvesting each species at its maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fishing rate. We show that widespread application of single-species MSY policies would in general cause severe deterioration in ecosystem structure, in particular the loss of top predator species. This supports the long-established practice in fisheries management of protecting at least some smaller “forage” species specifically for their value in supporting larger piscivores.},

	abstract = {Natural mortality (M) is one of the most influential parameters in fisheries stock assessment and management. It relates directly to stock productivity and reference points used for fisheries management advice. Unfortunately, M is also very difficult to estimate, and hence very uncertain. Representing the uncertainty in M and how this influences estimates of management quantities is therefore an important component of conducting stock as­ sessments. This paper outlines the range of methods available to estimate M for use in stock assessment. The methods include those based on maximum age, life history theory, relationships between “well-known” values for M (those found in the literature and based on data for the stock being assessed) and covariates, use of tagging data and catch curve analysis, and estimation within a single- or multi-species stock assessment model. All methods are likely subject to bias and imprecision due to incorrect assumptions and incomplete data. Further­ more, M is generally assumed to be constant over time, age, and sex - assumptions that are unlikely to be true for any stock. Based on our review, there is an obvious benefit to directly estimating M using data and within a stock assessment while assigning a prior based on empirical methods. This approach effectively uses all the available information while also representing the uncertainty. Carefully examining diagnostics and checking for model misspecification is required to ensure that the available data and stock assessment model assumptions are appropriately informative about M when it is estimated during the model fitting process. For situations where direct estimation is not possible (a condition found in data-limited to data-rich stock assessments), the use of multiple methods with robust sensitivity exploration is recommended. Even when direct data are integrated into a stock assessment, we recommend using other methods to estimate M and analysing the direct data outside the stock assessment model as diagnostic tools.},

            Size structure of fish stock plays an important role in maintaining sustainability of the population. Size distribution of an exploited stock is predicted to shift toward small individuals caused by size-selective fishing and/or warming; however, their relative contribution remains relatively unexplored. In addition, existing analyses on size structure have focused on univariate size-based indicators (SBIs), such as mean length, evenness of size classes, or the upper 95-percentile of the length frequency distribution; these approaches may not capture full information of size structure. To bridge the gap, we used the variation partitioning approach to examine how the size structure (composition of size classes) responded to fishing, warming and the interaction. We analyzed 28 exploited stocks in the West US, Alaska and North Sea. Our result shows fishing has the most prominent effect on the size structure of the exploited stocks. In addition, the fish stocks experienced higher variability in fishing is more responsive to the temperature effect in their size structure, suggesting that fishing may elevate the sensitivity of exploited stocks in responding to environmental effects. The variation partitioning approach provides complementary information to univariate SBIs in analyzing size structure.},

	abstract = {For a ﬁsh community to persist over time, all species must be able on average to replace themselves on a one-for-one basis over their lifetime. We use this principle and a size-based equilibrium model where asymptotic length is used as a functional trait to investigate how natural mortality should scale with size within and across pelagic and demersal species of North Sea teleosts. The model predicts natural mortality to scale with body length raised to a power of 21.66 at current levels of exploitation. Additionally, natural mortality of demersal species should be proportional to asymptotic length raised to a power of 0.80, so generating a higher natural mortality at a given length for large species than for small ones. The model also suggests that the exponent in the scaling of the von Bertalanffy growth parameter K with asymptotic length should be more negative for pelagic than for demersal species. We test our results by analysing independent estimates of predation mortality, the scaling of maximum recruitment per unit of spawning-stock biomass with asymptotic length, and the general relationship between K and asymptotic length for demersal and pelagic families of ﬁsh. All tests are consistent with our modelling results.},

A rapid exponential decline in the coefficients of variation of length with age was a dominant characteristic of most short‐lived stocks. Conversely, in most long‐lived stocks, the coefficients of variation of length remained relatively constant, declined gradually, or increased slightly with age.

We used a meta-analytical approach to test for delayed density dependence using 34 time series of sockeye data. We found no consistent evidence for delayed density-dependent mortality using spawner – spring fry or spawner–recruit data. We did find evidence for delayed density-dependent mortality at a 1 year lag for the spawner – fall fry and the spawner–smolt data; however, effects at lags greater than 1 year were weak and not statistically significant. Between-cohort interactions at a 1-year lag are not sufficient to cause the observed cycles in adult abundance, although they will tend to reinforce patterns established by other mechanisms.

                  Population regulation is a central concept in ecology, yet in many cases its presence and the underlying mechanisms are difficult to demonstrate. The current paradigm maintains that marine fish populations are predominantly regulated by density‐dependent recruitment.
                
                
                  While it is known that density‐dependent somatic growth can be present too, its general importance remains unknown and most practical applications neglect it. This study aimed to close this gap by for the first time quantifying and comparing density dependence in growth and recruitment over a large set of fish populations.
                
                
                  We fitted density‐dependent models to time‐series data on population size, recruitment and age‐specific weight from commercially exploited fish populations in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. Data were standardized to enable a direct comparison within and among populations, and estimated parameters were used to quantify the impact of density regulation on population biomass.
                
                
                  Statistically significant density dependence in recruitment was detected in a large proportion of populations (70\%), whereas for density dependence in somatic growth the prevalence of density dependence depended heavily on the method (26\% and 69\%). Despite age‐dependent variability, the density dependence in recruitment was consistently stronger among age groups and between alternative approaches that use weight‐at‐age or weight increments to assess growth. Estimates of density‐dependent reduction in biomass underlined these results: 97\% of populations with statistically significant parameters for growth and recruitment showed a larger impact of density‐dependent recruitment on population biomass.
                
                
                  The results reaffirm the importance of density‐dependent recruitment in marine fishes, yet they also show that density dependence in somatic growth is not uncommon. Furthermore, the results are important from an applied perspective because density dependence in somatic growth affects productivity and catch composition, and therefore the benefits of maintaining fish populations at specific densities.},

This assumption is challenged by laboratory and lake studies and some recent indications from marine systems that demonstrate density-dependent regulation late in life. By accounting for spatial dynamics of a population, something that has previously been ignored in models of ﬁsh, we show that density-dependent regulation is determined by the size of the habitat: in small habitats, for example small lakes, regulation occurs late in life, while it can occur early in large habitats. When regulation happens late in life, ﬁsheries yield is maximized by exploitation of mainly juvenile ﬁsh, while exploiting mature ﬁsh maximizes yield if regulation happens early. We review and interpret observations of density dependence in the light of the theory. Our results challenge the current assumption that density dependence always occurs early in life and highlights the need for an increased understanding of density-dependent processes. This can only come about by a change of focus from determining stock-recruitment relationships towards understanding when and how density-dependent regulation occurs in nature.},

              The limiting distribution, when
              n
              is large, of the greatest or least of a sample of
              n
              , must satisfy a functional equation which limits its form to one of two main types. Of these one has, apart from size and position, a single parameter
              h
              , while the other is the limit to which it tends when
              h
              tends to zero.
            
            
              The appropriate limiting distribution in any case may be found from the manner in which the probability of exceeding any value
              x
              tends to zero as
              x
              is increased. For the normal distribution the limiting distribution has
              h
              = 0.
            
            
              From the normal distribution the limiting distribution is approached with extreme slowness; the final series of forms passed through as the ultimate form is approached may be represented by the series of limiting distributions in which

A power regression model is commonly used to explain the relationship between fish weight and length. However, this requires costly measurements of fish length. The present study applies machine learning techniques to predict fish weight from fish images, bypassing the length measurement step. In this study, we validate the feasibility of predicting fish weight from images directly. We use a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approach to predict fish weight from images by building regression models. The deep CNNs architecture VGG-11, ResNet18 and DenseNet-121 are chosen to train the models. The fish images have different scales (length-pixel ratio) without including a ruler as a reference. The trained regressors of these three architectures reach R2 0.94, 0.95 and 0.96 on the test set. Our results support the feasibility of fish weight prediction with the CNNs model from images directly. The fish images look similar to humans, but CNNs regressors can detect the different fish weights. The CNNs regressors also can detect the fish images with different length-pixel ratios.},

We were able to successfully predict the harvest–release outcome for 99\% of ﬁsh caught in the training data set and 96\% of ﬁsh caught in the test data set. Unsuccessful predictions were mostly attributed to predicting harvest of ﬁsh that were released. Fish length was the most essential feature examined for predicting angler harvest. Other important predictive harvest–release features included the number of individuals of the same species caught, geographic location of an angler’s residence, distance traveled, and time spent ﬁshing. The XGBoost algorithm was able to effectively predict the harvest–release decision and revealed hidden and intricate relationships that are often unaccounted for with classical analysis techniques. Exposing and accounting for these angler–ﬁsh intricacies is critical for ﬁsheries conservation and management.},

To describe the external shape of the otolith, normalized Fourier elliptical descriptors were extracted. For each species, the analysis of shape data was performed in two steps. The first step was investigating the potential effects of confounding factors such as fish size, symmetry between right and left otoliths, sexual dimorphism and spatial distribution. When location showed a significant effect on otolith shape, a second step coupling two complementary analyses was performed with hierarchical clustering (unsupervised machine learning) and linear discriminant analysis with jackknifed prediction (supervised machine learning), allowing characterization of the potential stock limits for each of the treated species. The results show that, for the nine species treated, only two species (Etelis carbunculus and Pristipomoides filamentosus) show spatial structuring around Reunion Island with, for each of them, two stocks potentially separated along a northwest/southeast axis. These results show that some species around La Réunion Island may have local subpopulations.},

	abstract = {The ﬁsh weight is a very important factor in ﬁsheries science and management since it explains the growth and living conditions of ﬁsh populations. A power regression model has been commonly used to explain the relationship between the ﬁsh length and the weight. In this work, Genetic Programming (GP) for symbolic regression is used to build a new model for predicting the ﬁsh weight, which allows us to include more features into the model to discover any hidden relationship, and the GP based symbolic regression makes the model interpretable comparing with other machine learning methods. A publicly available dataset is taken with four species of ﬁsh which includes more features than just the ﬁsh length that is commonly used in existing models. The proposed GP based symbolic regression method has been examined on those four species. The results are compared with the weight prediction baseline methods including Linear Regression, Power Regression model, k-Nearest Neighbour, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. GP performs better, or at least as good as the baseline methods on the test set. Furthermore, the generated GP models also can select different features for different species to improve the prediction performance due to GP’s explicit feature selection ability. Some models are interpretable with relatively simple expression. The GP method is also able to ﬁnd models that are similar to the power regression model, but more features are included rather than a single length feature to gain improved prediction performance.},

	abstract = {The accurate labeling of species and size of specimens plays a pivotal role in fish auctions conducted at fishing ports. These labels, among other relevant information, serve as determinants of the objectivity of the auction preparation process, underscoring the indispensable nature of a reliable labeling system. Historically, this task has relied on manual processes, rendering it vulnerable to subjective interpretations by the involved personnel, therefore compromising the value of the merchandise. Consequently, the digitization and implementation of an automated labeling system are proposed as a viable solution to this ongoing challenge. This study presents an automatic system for labeling species and size, leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks. Specifically, the performance of VGG16, EfficientNetV2L, Xception, and ResNet152V2 networks is thoroughly examined, incorporating data augmentation techniques and fine-tuning strategies. The experimental findings demonstrate that for species classification, the EfficientNetV2L network excels as the most proficient model, achieving an average F-Score of 0.932 in its automatic mode and an average F-Score of 0.976 in its semi-automatic mode. Concerning size classification, a semi-automatic model is introduced, where the Xception network emerges as the superior model, achieving an average F-Score of 0.949.},

It can be exploited in ﬁsh farms to automate everyday procedures including size measurement and optimal harvest time estimation, ﬁsh health assessment, quantiﬁcation of feeding needs, etc. It can also be used in an open sea environment to monitor ﬁsh size, behavior and the population of various species. An efﬁcient deep learning technique for ﬁsh detection is employed and adapted, while methods for ﬁsh tracking are also proposed. The ﬁsh orientation is classiﬁed in order to apply a shape alignment technique that is based on the Ensemble of Regression Trees machine learning method. Shape alignment allows the estimation of ﬁsh dimensions (length, height) and the localization of ﬁsh body parts of particular interest such as the eyes and gills. The proposed method can estimate the position of 18 landmarks with an accuracy of about 95\% from low-contrast underwater images where the ﬁsh can be hardly distinguished from its background. Hardware and software acceleration techniques have been applied at the shape alignment process reducing the frame processing latency to less than 0.5 us on a general purpose computer and less than 16 ms on an embedded platform. As a case study, the developed system has been trained and tested with several Mediterranean ﬁsh species in the category of seabream. A large public dataset with low-resolution underwater videos and images has also been developed to test the proposed system under worst case conditions.},

	abstract = {Fish size and mass information during diﬀerent growth stages is important for precise feeding regime management, oxygen consumption calculations, antibiotic prescription and improving ﬁsh welfare, but also to facilitate decisions on grading, harvesting and time to harvest. The main purpose of this study was to develop an automatic system to estimate ﬁsh mass using ﬁsh dorsal geometrical features and machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). To develop the model, Kinect as a RGB-D camera was used to acquire depth map and top view images of 295 farmed seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax, L.) of diﬀerent sizes. Eight dorsal geometric features were extracted and used for model development. Ten-fold cross validation was used to optimize and validate the models. Comparison of models was made in term of the coeﬃcient of determination (Rc2v) and Root Mean Square Error of prediction (RMSEP) of cross validation. Both models exhibited signiﬁcant prediction, however, SVM algorithm with Rc2v of 0.872 (p {\textless} 0.01) and RMSE of 0.13 gave a slightly better prediction of weight compared to RF with Rc2v of 0.868 (p {\textless} 0.01) and RMSE of 0.13 was the highest R2. Subsequently, Infrared reﬂection system (IREF) which is composed of a NIR range camera with an external illuminator, was also used in this study to acquire 20 ﬁsh dorsal images inside the tank. Like validation results, both algorithms had the signiﬁcant prediction, however, despite the validation results, RF with R2 = 0.84(p {\textless} 0.01)andRMSE= 0.12 was better in comparison to SVM with R2 = 0.72(p {\textless} 0.01)andRMSE= 0.16. The study demonstrated that seabass geometrical dorsal features together with machine learning algorithms could be used for mass predictions. Furthermore, the IREF system can be used as a reliable, inexpensive, stressfree and accurate sensor for monitoring and estimating ﬁsh mass during cultivation within the tank.},

	abstract = {Assessing the health of fish populations relies on determining the length of fish in sample species subsets, in conjunction with other key ecosystem markers; thereby, inferring overall health of communities. Despite attempts to use artificial intelligence (AI) to measure fish, most measurement remains a manual process, often necessitating fish being removed from the water. Overcoming this limitation and potentially harmful intervention by measuring fish without disturbance in their natural habitat would greatly enhance and expedite the process. Stereo baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS) are widely used as a non-invasive, stressless method for manually counting and measuring fish in aquaculture, fisheries and conservation management. However, the application of deep learning (DL) to stereo-BRUVS image processing is showing encouraging progress towards replacing the manual and labour-intensive task of precisely locating the heads and tails of fish with computer-vision-based algorithms. Here, we present a generalised, semi-automated method for measuring the length of fish using DL with near-human accuracy for numerous species of fish. Additionally, we combine the DL method with a highly precise stereo-BRUVS calibration method, which uses calibration cubes to ensure precision within a few millimetres in calculated lengths. In a human versus DL comparison of accuracy, we show that, although DL commonly slightly over-estimates or under-estimates length, with enough repeated measurements, the two values average and converge to the same length, demonstrated by a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99 for n=3954 measurement in ‘out-of-sample’ test data. We demonstrate, through the inclusion of visual examples of stereo-BRUVS scenes, the accuracy of this approach. The head-to-tail measurement method presented here builds on, and advances, previously published object detection for stereo-BRUVS. Furthermore, by replacing the manual process of four careful mouse clicks on the screen to precisely locate the head and tail of a fish in two images, with two fast clicks anywhere on that fish in those two images, a significant reduction in image processing and analysis time is expected. By reducing analysis times, more images can be processed; thereby, increasing the amount of data available for environmental reporting and decision making.},

We integrate two key data modalities that are related to ﬁsh ages: the entire range of wavenumbers of FT-NIR spectra and corresponding biological and geospatial data for nearly 9000 walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) specimens. The proposed model extracts informative spectral features automatically and elucidates hidden structural relationships associated with ﬁsh growth to improve age predictions. Absorbance associated with 7000 to 4000 cm−1 wavenumbers had the highest inﬂuence on model predictions followed by ﬁsh length, latitude, depth, and temperature. The optimal model resulted in good overall performance with an R2 of 0.93 and RMSE of 0.83 for training data set and R2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 0.91 for test data set. MMCNN’s age predictions were comparable to microscope-based ages yielding as good or slightly better precision. Moreover, the model outperformed classical partial least squares analysis of otolith spectra and remedied prediction bias at older ages of ﬁsh.},

	abstract = {Citizen science platforms, social media and smart phone applications enable the collection of large amounts of georeferenced images. This provides a huge opportunity in biodiversity and ecological research, but also creates challenges for efﬁcient data handling and processing. Recreational and small-scale ﬁsheries is one of the ﬁelds that could be revolutionised by efﬁcient, widely accessible and machine learning-based processing of georeferenced images. Most non-commercial inland and coastal ﬁsheries are considered data poor and are rarely assessed, yet they provide multiple societal beneﬁts and can have substantial ecological impacts. Given that large quantities of georeferenced ﬁsh images are being collected by ﬁshers every day, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and computer vision applications offer a great opportunity to automate their analyses by providing species identiﬁcation, and potentially also ﬁsh size estimation. This would deliver data needed for ﬁsheries management and ﬁsher engagement. To date, however, many AI image analysis applications in ﬁsheries are focused on the commercial sector, limited to speciﬁc species or settings, and are not publicly available. In addition, using AI and computer vision tools often requires a strong background in programming. In this study, we aim to facilitate broader use of computer vision tools in ﬁsheries and ecological research by compiling an open-source user friendly and modular framework for large-scale image storage, handling, annotation and automatic classiﬁcation, using cost- and labour-efﬁcient methodologies. The tool is based on TensorFlow Lite Model Maker library, and includes data augmentation and transfer learning techniques applied to different convolutional neural network models. We demonstrate the potential application of this framework using a small example dataset of ﬁsh images taken through a recreational ﬁshing smartphone application. The framework presented here can be used to develop region-speciﬁc species identiﬁcation models, which could potentially be combined into a larger hierarchical model.},

                  An image can encode date, time, location and camera information as metadata and implicitly encodes species information and data on human activity, for example the size distribution of fish removals. Accurate length estimates can be made from images using a fiducial marker; however, their manual extraction is time‐consuming and estimates are inaccurate without control over the imaging system. This article presents a methodology which uses machine vision to estimate the total length (TL) of a fusiform fish (European sea bass).
                
                
                  Three regional convolutional neural networks (R‐CNN) were trained from public images. Images of European sea bass were captured with a fiducial marker with three non‐specialist cameras. Images were undistorted using the intrinsic lens properties calculated for the camera in OpenCV; then TL was estimated using machine vision (MV) to detect both marker and subject. MV performance was evaluated for the three R‐CNNs under downsampling and rotation of the captured images.
                
                
                  Each R‐CNN accurately predicted the location of fish in test images (mean intersection over union, 93\%) and estimates of TL were accurate, with percent mean bias error (\%MBE [95\% CIs]) = 2.2\% [2.0, 2.4]). Detections were robust to horizontal flipping and downsampling. TL estimates at absolute image rotations {\textgreater}20° became increasingly inaccurate but \%MBE [95\% CIs] was reduced to −0.1\% [−0.2, 0.1] using machine learning to remove outliers and model bias.
                
                
                  Machine vision can classify and derive measurements of species from images without specialist equipment. It is anticipated that ecological researchers and managers will make increasing use of MV where image data are collected (e.g. in remote electronic monitoring, virtual observations, wildlife surveys and morphometrics) and MV will be of particular utility where large volumes of image data are gathered.},

	abstract = {Noninvasive morphological feature monitoring is essential in fish culture, since these features are currently measured manually with a high cost. These morphological parameters can concern the size or mass of the fish, or its health as indicated, for example, by the color of the eyes or the gills. Several approaches have been proposed, based either on image processing or machine learning techniques. In this paper, both of these approaches have been combined in a unified environment with novel techniques (e.g., edge or corner detection and pattern stretching) to estimate the fish’s relative length, height and the area it occupies in the image. The method can be extended to estimate the absolute dimensions if a pair of cameras is used for obscured or slanted fish. Moreover, important fish parts such as the caudal, spiny and soft dorsal, pelvic and anal fins are located. Four species popular in fish cultures have been studied: Dicentrarchus labrax (sea bass), Diplodus puntazzo, Merluccius merluccius (cod fish) and Sparus aurata (sea bream). Taking into consideration that there are no large public datasets for the specific species, the training and testing of the developed methods has been performed using 25 photographs per species. The fish length estimation error ranges between 1.9\% and 13.2\%, which is comparable to the referenced approaches that are trained with much larger datasets and do not offer the full functionality of the proposed method.},

                  Many questions in ecology and evolutionary biology consider response variables that are functions (e.g. species‐abundance distributions) rather than a single scalar value (e.g. species richness). Although methods for analysing function‐valued data have been available for several decades, ecological and evolutionary applications are rare.
                
                
                  
                    We outline methods for regression when the response variable is a function (‘function regression') and introduce the
                    r
                    package
                    FREE
                    , which focuses on straightforward implementation and interpretation of function regression analyses. Several computational methods are implemented, including machine learning and several Bayesian methods. We compare different methods using simulated data and real ecological data on individual‐size distributions (
                    ISD
                    s) of fish and trees.
                  
                
                
                  No single method performed best overall, with several performing equally well for a given data set. Which method to use depends on sample sizes and the questions being considered; in many cases, a consensus approach should be used to combine or compare fitted models.
                
                
                  
                    Function regression allows the direct modelling of many function‐valued data (e.g. species‐abundance distributions) rather than having to reduce those functions to a single scalar response variable (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity indices). Our ecological examples using
                    ISD
                    data show that larger rivers support more‐even fish‐size distributions than smaller rivers and that low initial planting densities lead to more‐even tree‐size distributions than high initial planting densities. Function regression provided more informative and intuitive interpretations of these data than conventional non‐function‐valued approaches.},

The research objective was to design and develop a hardware / software system that would have the potential to capture meaningful data from which to extract ﬁsh size, swim trajectory, and swim velocity, ultimately as information toward an assessment of ﬁsh health. The initial work presented in this paper discusses the development choices of the prototype system, including various combinations of lighting and camera positions both inside and outside of the aquaculture tanks, and several post-processing techniques to isolate ﬁsh in video, calibrate the distance from camera to ﬁsh through water, and infer ﬁsh trajectories and swim velocities. Preliminary results provided a qualitative assessment of such a system. Speciﬁc results on the system’s ability to detect ﬁshes’ positions, trajectories, and velocities are presently limited to observational outcomes and descriptive statistics rather than large-scale quantitative analysis. The present work lays a foundation for a future commercially hardened system that would be required for the collection of larger datasets, which would in turn facilitate the future development of machine learning (ML) algorithms to begin to statistically correlate data to ﬁsh conditions and behaviors in near-real time.},

For this, it is important to understand the distribution of body length and mass of the farmed ﬁshes.

In this paper, we present a vision based approach for automatic detection, length estimation in the pixel domain and body mass determination of ﬁshes in an aqua farming environment. We evaluate Mask-RCNN, YOLO algorithms for detecting ﬁshes with inexpensive single camera set up placed above the water tank. We obtain a mean average precision (mAP50) score of 0.893 with the YOLO models for ﬁsh detection. Subsequently, we use B-splines for estimating the length of ﬁsh in the pixel domain followed by mass estimation by ﬁtting the Length-Weight relationship using regression.},

Computer vision-based algorithm processes and analyzes the captured image to locate a ﬁsh inside a bounding box. Sophisticated shape analysis and machine learning technique were then applied to the bounding box region of image to identify and extract the shape contour of the ﬁshes on the image. Next, this contour was used to obtain the location and length of the ﬁshes in image coordinates. Then, by using the spatial information provided to the system earlier (calibration), the scaling information (mm/pixel) can be used to transform the image length to physical scale. Beside, the ﬁsh activity also can be calculated based on the difference between current and previous image frame. The application of the research results can provide information for understanding the growing trend of ﬁshes for ﬁsh farmers. In addition, the conversion of ﬁsh length and weight and detection of ﬁsh activity performed during feeding can serve as critical references for precise feeding management to mitigate feed waste and impede water quality deterioration.},

	abstract = {Fisheries around the world show an overexploitation, which has led communities to ﬁnd management strategies to tackle the problem. However, strategies are often taken on the basis of statistical data of dubious real-world utility. To address this problem, accurate biomass extraction calculations are required. The ﬁsh market is the place where vessels disembark their catches daily, and therefore a valuable point of contact to retrieve this information. Many small-sized ﬁsheries, as stated by FAO, are a majority in some areas, and small ﬁsh markets have more diﬃculties installing ﬁxed industrial cameras. This paper contributes to these eﬀorts by proposing a complete workﬂow for ﬁsh size regression from uncalibrated images from a mobile camera using ﬁsh instance segmentation and classiﬁcation data provided by a pretrained neural network. Ground truth ﬁsh sizes are calculated via homography, and used for comparison. The results show a mean absolute error of 1.7614±2.7633 cm using the CatBoost regressor, and even better at 1.2713±2.0616 cm when considering some calibration parameters at the input.},

Existing dimension detection algorithms based on computer vision techniques normally leverage machine learning or deep learning to provide meaningful effects. The objective of this paper is to provide a contactless approach for estimating ﬁsh length using ruler scale technique. This paper discussed an Hough line transform-based approach for estimating the length of ﬁshes, with the emphasis on detecting ruler scale. The experiments conducted showed a good success rate with accuracy and indicated that the proposed approach can be used to detect ﬁsh length in ﬁsheries farm and aquaculture.},

	abstract = {Cascading human pressures and environmental change are affecting the natural dynamics of animal populations. Forecasting population abundances from time-series data provides an important avenue for testing competing ecological theories, and for supporting conservation planning and sustainable use, yet changing system dynamics may lead to erroneous predictions. Predictions from a model fitted and tested on historical system dynamics may become irrelevant if system dynamics change. Here we describe methods to test forecast skill in a rapidly changing system where model parameters are likely to be non-stationary. We presented two ways to split time-series into training and test datasets so that training data were: 1) contemporary to the testing data (‘modern split’), and 2) not contemporary to the testing data (‘legacy split’). As a case-study, we use animal abundance data from a 30-year time-series from a global warming hotspot. We tested our approach on four temperate reef species with different temporal trends. The case-study and simulation tests confirmed larger forecast errors in legacy split when compared to the modern split. We found that the legacy split had errors that could be more than for times larger for a species that had a rapid collapse in abundance and non-stationary population dynamics. As expected for the species with rapid collapse, the legacy split estimated much higher forecast error than the modern split. Our approach is applicable to a large range of species and systems, including fisheries and threatened species population monitoring, where rapidly changing environments present threats to both the species and management efficacy. Accumulated lessons from across species and systems should shed light on critical generalities that precede broader ecosystem change.},

            Preserving maritime ecosystems is a major concern for governments and administrations. Additionally, improving fishing industry processes, as well as that of fish markets, to have a more precise evaluation of the captures, will lead to a better control on the fish stocks. Many automated fish species classification and size estimation proposals have appeared in recent years, however, they require data to train and evaluate their performance. Furthermore, this data needs to be organized and labelled. This paper presents a dataset of images of fish trays from a local wholesale fish market. It includes pixel-wise (mask) labelled specimens, along with species information, and different size measurements. A total of 1,291 labelled images were collected, including 7,339 specimens of 59 different species (in 60 different class labels). This dataset can be of interest to evaluate the performance of novel fish instance segmentation and/or size estimation methods, which are key for systems aimed at the automated control of stocks exploitation, and therefore have a beneficial impact on fish populations in the long run.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty in stock assessment can be reduced if accurate and precise length composition of catch is available. Length data are usually manually collected, although this method is costly and time-consuming. Recently, some studies have estimated fish species and length from images using deep learning by installing camera systems in fishing vessels or a fish auction center (A´lvarez -Ellacuria et al., 2020; Lekunberri et al., 2022; Ovalle et al., 2022; Palmer et al., 2022). Once a deep learning model is properly trained, it does not require expensive and timeconsuming manual labor. However, several studies on the deep learning models had monitoring fishing prac­ tices using electronic monitoring systems; therefore, it is necessary to solve many issues, such as counting the total number of fish in the catch. In this study, we proposed a new deep learning-based method to estimate fish length using images. Species identification was not performed by the model, and images were taken manually by the measurers; however, length composition was obtained only for non-occluded fish detected by the model. A smartphone application was developed to calculate scale information (cm/pixel) from a known size fish box in fish images, and the Mask R-CNN (Region-based convolutional neural networks) model was trained using 76,161 fish to predict non-occluded fish. Two experiments were conducted to confirm whether the proposed method resulted in errors in the length composition. First, we manually measured the total length (TL) for four species and one genus (categories), estimated the TL using a deep learning method, and calculated the bias. Second, multiple fish in a fish box were photographed simultaneously, and the relative difference between the mean TL estimated from the non-occluded fish and the true mean TL from all fish was calculated. The results showed that the biases of all five categories were from − 0.69 cm to 0.37 cm and the range of difference was from − 1.14 \% to 1.40 \% regardless of the number of fish in the fish box. The deep learning method was used not to replace the measurer but to increase their measurement efficiency. The proposed method is expected to increase opportu­ nities for the application of deep learning-based fish length estimation in areas of research that are different from the scope of conventional electronic monitoring systems.},

	abstract = {The development and effective compliance of efficient fishing policies that guarantee both the sustainability of marine resources and fishing activity is one of the main challenges that policymakers nowadays face. At EU level, successful implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) depends, at a large extent, on the capacity to quantify catches on board commercial vessels. Because of the large number of fishing vessels and the high number of trips to be monitored classic, monitoring methods, mainly based on inspections, are not effective. Therefore, the use of electronic devices to quantify fishing catches is gaining relevance. The data provided by such devices, in combination with mathematical models, may be used to assess the state of the different fishing stocks and to optimize the fishing activity. In this work, we consider different algorithms based on Deep Learning (DL) for species identification and length estimation. On the one hand, for the instance segmentation task, we have adapted the Mask R-CNN algorithm to the problem of fish species identification. On the other hand, the MobileNet-V1 convolutional neural network is used for the estimation of the length of each individual. The results show that, when overlapping among individuals is moderate to low, both the identification and length estimation models are able to satisfactorily quantify the catch. In situations where overlapping among in­ dividuals is large, results need further improvements.},

A non-invasive approach is introduced using underwater films to estimate fish biomass in turbid conditions. This study presents the “Aquatic WeightNet” dataset, targeting the Genetically Improved Formed Tilapia (GIFT) Tilapia species, and addresses the challenge of unclear images with pre­ processing techniques like dehazing and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). YOLOv8, a leading object detection model modified to accommodate the custom Aquatic WeightNet dataset's varied image sizes with five detection heads, P2 to P6, is employed, achieving a recall of 0.997 and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.899 within the 50–95\% Intersection over Union (IoU) range. Fish biomass estimation assesses depth, length, and width using regression models for calculation. A three-phase grid search identifies the most effective models, with the Extra Trees Regressor outperforming depth estimation with mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.63 and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 and the Random Forest Regressor for length and width (MAE of 0.01 and R2 of 0.99). For biomass estimation, the Extra Trees Regressor again performs well (MAE of 0.004 and R2 of 0.99), which is critical for determining optimal feed quantities to enhance aquaculture efficiency. This study emphasizes a non-invasive method to estimate fish biomass, optimizing the effectiveness and ecological sus­ tainability of fish farming in murky waters through advanced detection algorithms and robust regression models.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of fish length is crucial aquaculture processes. Precise and real-time estimation of fish length aids fish farmers in formulating effective farming strategies. Existing methods for estimating the length of un­ derwater fish have made significant advancements in overcoming the interferences present in complex under­ water environments. Nevertheless, the measurement results of some methods continue to be limited by variations in the refractive index of multiple media and deviations in imaging angles, resulting in measurement errors and diminished practicality. Consequently, we propose a measurement method that aims to address the aforemen­ tioned challenges in fisheries aquaculture by providing more accurate and cost-effective solutions. This method initially introduces the concept of regressing multiple media into a single medium to correct underwater depth estimation and enhance underwater imaging quality. Subsequently, an accurate plane fitting algorithm is applied to precisely fit the fish body plane and extract its corresponding normal vector information. Finally, taking into account the light propagation path and accounting for the limitations of precise values, we utilize the geometric relationship between the length of the bounding box and the actual length of the fish to calculate a more accurate estimation of fish body length. Experimental validation showcases the applicability of our measurement method to diverse fish species and substantiates its exceptional performance in both experimental and real-world sce­ narios. The maximum average relative errors for each group are within 8\%, and the average relative error is 3.28\% under the exact value constraints presented in the experiments. This method makes a significant contribution to fish length estimation and offers valuable insights for applications in fisheries and aquaculture.},

                  Benthic fishes are a common target of scientific monitoring but are difficult to quantify because of their close association to bottom habitats that are hard to access. Advances in image‐acquisition technologies, machine vision and deep learning have made capturing and quantifying fishes with cameras increasingly feasible. We present a method and open‐source software called ‘FishScale’ to estimate benthic fish lengths, numeric abundance and biomass density in underwater environments assessed with down‐looking monocular images.
                
                
                  ‘FishScale’ estimates fish abundances and size frequencies from near‐nadir monocular images where fish have already been semantically segmented. The software accounts for lens distortion, underwater magnification effects and fish body curvature to automatically estimate fish lengths and the areas of images where they were captured. Numeric and biomass density are estimated through a deterministic machine vision algorithm that requires a user‐provided length‐weight relationship for species of interest and calibration images.
                
                
                  
                    Results from validation studies show that lengths and weights can be estimated with high accuracy and precision for round goby (
                    Neogobius melanostomus
                    ) captured in distorted action camera images, and from large‐bodied lake trout (
                    Salvelinus namaycush
                    ) imaged with a machine vision camera. The real‐world utility of the approach is demonstrated in a case study estimating round goby abundances and size frequencies along a 10.7‐km transect surveyed with an autonomous underwater vehicle in Lake Michigan, USA.
                  
                
                
                  Our validation studies demonstrate that the approach estimates benthic and benthopelagic fish lengths and weights with little bias and good accuracy and precision for species with much different body shapes and sizes. The method is applicable to data collected using a variety of nadir imaging approaches with widespread applications to fisheries monitoring and quantification of any species or object for which nadir images and working distances between the camera and feature of interest are available.},

This is an important challenge especially for remote and disperse locations where ﬁsh sampling poses unbearable costs, leading to limited spatial sampling schemes, limited data on rare and occasional landed species, and erroneous and biased observations. In this article, we propose a new autonomous system that can be installed on monitoring spots or on board ﬁshing vessels, which is able to remotely acquire all the landed or captured ﬁsh and measure it automatically without any physical interaction. The system uses (i) a camera and a 3D sensor to obtain a complete XYZ reading of the ﬁsh and (ii) a convolutional neural network, trained for a representative set of species to detect and measure the individuals visible in a box. The system was validated in real conditions, using continuous observations of the landed ﬁsh in three islands of the Azores Archipelago, for 2 years. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the measuring system and an analysis of the sampled data, by comparing the results of the proposed method with the traditional sampling methodology for a given period.},

	abstract = {In the smart mariculture, batch testing of breeding traits is a key issue in the breeding of improved ﬁsh varieties. The body length (BL), body width (BW) and body area (BA) features of ﬁsh are important indicators. They are of great signiﬁcance in breeding, feeding and classiﬁcation. To accurately and intelligently obtain the morphological characteristic sizes of ﬁsh in actual scenes, data augmentation is ﬁrst used to greatly expand the published ﬁsh dataset, thereby ensuring the robustness of the training model. Then, an improved U-net segmentation and measurement algorithm is proposed, which uses a dilated convolution with a dilation rate 2 and a convolution to partially replace the convolution in the original U-net. This operation can enlarge the partial convolution receptive ﬁeld and achieve more accurate segmentation for large targets in the scene. Finally, a line ﬁtting method based on the least squares method is proposed, which is combined with the body shape features of ﬁsh and can accurately measure the BL and BW of inclined ﬁsh. Experimental results show that the Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) is 97.6\% and the average relative error of the area is 0.69\%. Compared with the unimproved U-net, the average relative error of the area is reduced to about half. Moreover, with the improved U-net and the line ﬁtting method, the average relative error of BL and the average relative error of BW of inclined ﬁsh decrease to 0.37\% and 0.61\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Fish biomass is one of the reliable parameters that can provide insight into fish and environmental health. Estimation of biomass in a dense and occulted environment is an inevitable and challenging task in modern aquaculture industries, which has been addressed in this work. The proposed work aims to determine the length features of fish using a deep learning-based segmental analysis technique. It tends to analyze the visibility of fish segments like head, body, and tail to define a completely visible fish (CVF). YOLOv4 (You look only once –Version-4) deep learning model is trained and used to detect the fish head, body, and tail segments. The detected segments are associated using sequence constrained nearest neighborhood (NN) association technique guided with fish head orientation. Fish length is estimated using the measurement points identified in the CVF. The measurement point includes head-start, body-center, and tail-end points, which are identified using a convex hull and oriented bounding box (BB). A calibration curve expressing the length-mass relation is used to determine the fish biomass from the estimated length. The proposed methodology is applied to determine the biomass of the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) fishes in an occulted environment. Experimental results illustrate a 0.9451 mAP of the trained YOLOv4 model and about 95.4\% CVFs are detected accurately. A reliable accuracy of 94.15\% and 91.52\% is observed with testing and validation image sets respectively for biomass estimation.},

Thus, this data is often measured manually by directly catching ﬁsh with a net. However, this measurement method needs time-consuming, and hard work and leads damage and stress to ﬁsh. For overcoming this problem, an automatic measurement method with machine learning by using monocular camera is proposed in this paper. In general, conventional measurement methods are based on a stereo camera, which needs often large hardware amount and expensive. On the other hand, the proposed method is based on a monocular camera, which is small hardware amount and less expensive, this system can get depth data by utilizing machine learning algorithm and to automatically detect ﬁsh in images which are captured by a monocular camera. From experimental results on actual aquarium with dorado ﬁsh. The average relative error of the measurements is about 12.4\%, which is a relatively small error to obtain the ﬁsh size.},

	abstract = {Fish swimming speed is a standard measurement used for assessing the environment and behavior of fish in aquaculture. However, methods involving propeller-type data loggers, ultrasonic telemetry, and cameras have some limitations. Estimates of swimming speed by cameras are based on swimming trajectories; however, obtaining the swimming trajectories is difficult because the relative positions of the camera and fish body change owing to wave effects. The aim of this study was to describe and present a novel method to estimate the swimming speed of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) influenced by artificially generated waves. Tail-beat frequency was estimated from periodic changes in fish length measured using a stereo camera. The swimming speed was estimated from tail-beat frequency according to the relationship between them as obtained by camera measurement; we found that a fixed stereo camera can help estimate tail-beat frequencies. The estimated data from the moving stereo camera were within the 95\% prediction interval of the swimming speed estimation model constructed using the fixed stereo camera. Our study proves the potential of this method in aquaculture. Overall, this approach is a novel method to estimate the swimming speed influenced by wave conditions. In the future, this method can be automated for the identification of abnormal behaviors and detection of malformed fish.},

By calculating a fish-to-feed ratio, we regulate feed amounts to enhance system performance. The remaining fish segment’s length and width are converted into weight, guiding feed calculations for each session. We conducted experiments with 432 Nile Tilapia, using their measurements to train the Mask R-CNN model.

	abstract = {This study explores the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for age estimation in Pacific Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus orientalis) using otolith images. The objective is to assess the feasibility of CNNs as a cost-effective tool for fish age determination, while evaluating the potential improvements with imputing missing values in the auxiliary dataset and image augmentation techniques. Additionally, a user-friendly web tool is developed to enable public access to the CNN model. Three trained models, Baseline, Otolith Mass Imputation (OMI), and Otolith Mass Imputation and Image Augmentation (OMIA), are compared and evaluated based on performance metrics. The results highlight the superiority of the OMIA model, achieving the highest accuracy (±1-acc = 72.81\%) and lowest coefficient of variation (CV=7.38\%). The model’s predicted age distribution closely re­ sembles the ground truth, as well as the parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function. Heat maps reveal that the attributes used by the model, particularly the opaque zones on the ventral arm of the otolith, mimic the age identification strategies employed by human experts. However, the study identifies challenges, including poor performance and negative impacts on predictions due to data imputation for age groups (ages 4–5 and 25–27) with limited samples. Despite these limitations, this study represents a significant step towards machine learningbased age estimation, serving as a valuable aid in traditional fish aging studies. The implications for management and future research directions are also discussed.},

The main contribution of this research is in the development of a system for predicting the body biomass of live fingerlings and juveniles as an alternative to the traditional invasive estimation methods used by small and medium-sized fish farms. This paper provides an evaluation based on automatic frame selection with data augmentation by 10◦ rotation for biomass estimation of Pintado Real ®using video frames collected by a computer vision system that resulted in a new dataset called ALEV400P with 400 fingerlings ranging from approximately 1 to 32 grams. Three different deep learning frameworks were evaluated and also compared with five shallow learning algorithms. The results showed that the Deep Belief Network outperformed the others with R2 of 0.7 for batch 1. The combination of the automatic frame selection strategy by Euclidean distance from head to tail with data augmentation by 10-degree rotation optimized the prediction result using a dataset with high variability of fingerling sizes.},

However, critical assessments of even the most prominent theories are not always based on accurate interpretations of their underlying mechanistic models. This contribution addresses some of the major misunderstandings still causing the Gill-Oxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT) from being examined based on its actual structuring elements and assumptions, rather than erroneous perceptions. As we argue, recent critiques of the GOLT are based on implausible interpretations of respirometry data that are invoked to distinguish maintenance costs and overhead costs of growth. Discussing the current state of the debate, we emphasize the fact that fasting young and, thus, growing fish for short periods of time is not sufficient to suppress energy (i.e., oxygen) allocation to growth. In the process of dealing with these issues, several cases of apparent ‘counter-evidence’ are discussed. Highlighting the need to base critical discussions and examinations of the GOLT on its actual predictions, we recommend that testing the theory should focus on broad reviews or meta-analyses, e.g., on datasets of gill surface area and the relationship of these data to growth performance under different temperature regimes.},

              is large, of the greatest or least of a sample of
              n
              , must satisfy a functional equation which limits its form to one of two main types. Of these one has, apart from size and position, a single parameter
              h
              , while the other is the limit to which it tends when
              h
              tends to zero.
            
            
              The appropriate limiting distribution in any case may be found from the manner in which the probability of exceeding any value
              x
              tends to zero as
              x
              is increased. For the normal distribution the limiting distribution has
              h
              = 0.
            
            
              From the normal distribution the limiting distribution is approached with extreme slowness; the final series of forms passed through as the ultimate form is approached may be represented by the series of limiting distributions in which
