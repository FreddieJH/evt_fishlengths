Since we are dealing with the truncated normal distribution, instead of the normal, we need to make sure calculate the pdf and cdf when x > 0. We need to make sure that the pdf greater than 0 integrates to 1. 

Step 1. Calculate how much of the distribution is below zero. 

```{python}
from scipy.stats import norm
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

norm_constant = norm.cdf(0, 10, 5)

x = list(np.arange(-10, 30, 0.1))
print(x)

y = norm.cdf(x, 10, 5)

def f(t):
    return norm.cdf(t, 10, 5)

section = np.arange(-10, 0.1, 0.1)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(x,y)
plt.vlines(x = 0, ymin = 0, ymax = 1)
plt.xlabel('Body size (cm)')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.fill_between(section,f(section))


```


This area under the curve here, is equal to 0.0023 (2.3%) of the total area. We therefore need to normalise the cdf for the rest of the curve so that it sums to 1. The remaining curve is 0.977 (97.7%). So if a $F(x) = 0.5$, we first need to calculate the CDF greater than zero: $F(x) - F(0) = 0.499$ and then normalised it will be slightly higher than that, $F_norm(x) = 0.499/(1-0.023)$. 

For the log version of the pdf, instead of dividing by (1-0.023), we need to minus it, because of the product rule.
